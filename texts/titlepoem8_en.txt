This World is not Conclusion. %b
A Species stands beyond - %b
Invisible, as Music - %b
But positive, as Sound - %b
It beckons, and it baffles - %b 
Philosophy, dont know - %b
And through a Riddle, at the last - %b
Sagacity, must go - 
%p
- From "This World is not Conclusion", Emily Dickinson
