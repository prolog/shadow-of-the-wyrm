On the Cithriel Fragments
%p
By Asher of Yew

The Cithriel fragments, as they are commonly known, represent the oldest known
link with the ancient world.  They are thought to be from vases kept in the faerie
stronghold of Cithriel, so called "verse-pots" created by master potters and
inscribed by the great, nameless poets of the ancient age.  These represent the
only known record of the language of the faerie people.
%p
That we know anything at all about these pots is nothing short of remarkable.
Though their shape must forever remain a mystery, their translation is possible
only because of the surviving translation into Primal Elvish, the language of the
elves before the partition.  A remarkable find, it contains the text of the fragments,
the Primal Elvish translation, and above the faerie text, phonetic pronunciations
of the faerie words.
%p
The poems themselves are difficult to translate, because so little is known of the
faerie language, and because it is completely distinct from Primal Elvish.  As a
result, the translations themselves have become as important as the poems themselves,
and have become the starting point for new translations of the original fragments.
%p
The translations of the ur-text differ considerably.  The first fragment represents
a kind of keening for what is lost, and is presented in the original formal style,
heavily trochaic.  The second fragment presents a problem: it starts off in a trochaic
form, then quickly veers into free verse.  It is uncertain what "Eka" represents,
and has been a favoured subject of debate among scholars for generations.
