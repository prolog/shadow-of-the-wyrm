"Ah but," said craftie Trompart, "weete ye well, %b
That yonder in that wastefull wildernesse %b
Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell; %b
Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell, %b
And many wilde woodmen, which robbe and rend %b
All travellers; therefore advise ye well, %b
Before ye enterprise that way to wend: %b
One may his journey bring too soone to evill end." %b
