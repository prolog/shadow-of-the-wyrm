"Ah but," said craftie Trompart, "weete ye well,
That yonder in that wastefull wildernesse
Huge monsters haunt, and many dangers dwell;
Dragons, and Minotaures, and feendes of hell,
And many wilde woodmen, which robbe and rend
All travellers; therefore advise ye well,
Before ye enterprise that way to wend:
One may his journey bring too soone to evill end."
