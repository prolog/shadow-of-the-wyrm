Within the shrouds of myth, a kind of song %b
of lovers at the edges of the world, %b
their love accurs'd, a feeling held too strong %b
to keep the threads of fate from being purled %b
about them.  In the ancient woods so wild, %b
a pair whose love would ever grow and swell, %b
to make their names forever so reviled: %b
a man and woman caught beneath a spell, %b
the noble Tel and lovely lady Floridel.
%p
This story must begin before the birth %b
of Tel the King, the fated of the folk. %b
An augurer, they said, watched from the earth %b
and saw an eagle land on blighted oak. %b
"It must," she said, "be signal of a king, %b
a mighty man who yet has not been born - %b
whose will in later years will surely bring %b
his people to their knees, cast low and torn. %b
The Nine have willed this so, and so it must be sworn."
%p
And born he was, in fortress Cithriel, %b
the happy home, the fortress underground. %b
An ancient hall, a proper place to dwell %b
for kings and queens, and champions renowned. %b
So Tel the King was born to Sel and Shae, %b
good rulers, both, who kept a lengthy peace %b
between their kind and giants who in way %b
and deed sought war; sweet days would finally cease %b
when Tel raised sword in meddling Shiver's masterpiece.
%p
But first, he was a mewling, squealing babe, %b
with copper hair, and startling, sea-blue eyes - %b
a child who loved to run, but ever brave, %b
so fleet of foot, and quicker still to rise %b
to slights perceived, to all the things unsaid %b
but seen behind the veil of courtly grace. %b
For this was not a whelp who ever fled %b
the courtly hounds who lingered in that space - %b
the princeling made his presence felt within that place.
%p
And as the boy stepped boldly into youth, %b
above the hall, beside a reedy brook, %b
a shepherd-girl was born to simple truths: %b
to spring-time blooms, and laughter from the rook %b
that makes its spindly nest up in the boughs, %b
alight with all the colours of the wind. %b
Oh Floridel!  Who once was sweet, and now %b
your name is spoken thick with shame and sin - %b
the fledgeling turned, the evil goddess under skin.
%p
Surrounded by the presence of her sheep, %b
she learned to love each tiny lamb and ewe, %b
and then, one frigid spring, she learned to weep: %b
a stillborn lamb left stiff upon the dew. %b
And in this way, she wandered, year by year, %b
from quiet dells to wind-swept upland heaths %b
where ever with her flock she heard the clear %b
and present sounds, that cut with clarity %b
the stillness of the rich and green prosperity.
%p
And though austere to some, her life lacked none %b
for music, blown from flutes of hollow reeds, %b
whose simple notes sang soft beneath the sun, %b
hosannas to the earth that filled her needs. %b
Hosanna to the swiftly flowing water! %b
Hosanna to the oak that giveth shade! %b
Hosanna to the weather growing hotter! %b
Hosanna to the shelter of the glade! %b
Hosanna to the Lady and the things she made!
%p
For simple though it was, this life was good %b
and right.  A candle held against the world, %b
a spirit burning bright.  A symbol stood %b
in field and fen, this lovely shepherd-girl. %b
Held as she was within The Lady's arms %b
she soon would be so held within the hall %b
of Cithriel, and bound by all the charms %b
of fairy-kind, enrapt and held in thrall: %b
With Lady's loss, her love for Tel became her fall.
%p
The lovers met beneath a roiling sky. %b
A rider in the dawn, the noble Tel %b
astride a courser seeming as to fly %b
across the moor.  A hunt!  The horses swelled %b
and surged, to circle round the shepherd's flock. %b
Encircled by the lords, she never feared %b
for anything; she raised her voice to talk, %b
soprano free and lilting, high and clear %b
above the fray, a songbird's call upon the ear.
%p
"My name," she said with calm, "is Floridel. %b
I whither wander here upon these moors, %b
among the purple flowers, wherein I dwell %b
with sheep and lamb.  My life, I think, is pure. %b
For I am she who weathers in the hills; %b
who sleeps among her sheep, and then beholds %b
the stars above that shine despite the chill; %b
who watches under weather harsh and cold; %b
a witness as the seasons say how life unfolds."
%p
And watching from the saddle of his horse, %b
the young man Tel, resplendent as the sun. %b
Intrigued, for all around, a show of force, %b
each horseman drunk with glory that he'd won %b
on hunt or battlefield, each armed with spear %b
across the back, and Floridel unmoved. %b
She met the princeling's gaze, no trace of fear; %b
for, with no words, she knew that he approved. %b
Young Floridel, her mettle well and truly proved.
%p
He paused but for a moment; then he spoke, %b
"I've never met a person such as you - %b
who sees beneath the raiment and the cloak, %b
to speak her words so clear, to cut right through %b
the skein-and-tangle of my noble life. %b
Won't you come with me?  Beneath the earth %b
to Cithriel, our hall, forever rife %b
with feasting and with fill, a place of worth %b
where fairy-kind forever flits with joy and mirth."
%p
She let the words between them cut the air %b
to fall among the flowers on the ground, %b
and pausing for a moment, stopped to stare %b
at cowslips, flowering crimson, that she found %b
about her feet.  A kind of final gift %b
upon the moor.  A fairy ring of sorts, %b
and so she said, "The world is ever swift %b
to say what should be done.  And so, report %b
that in a week I'll join you in your fairy court."
%p
Her answer given, Floridel went west. %b
She took her flock and wandered for three days, %b
until she found a valley, green and blessed %b
with icy streams.  And then, she made her way %b
alone across the moor.  She wept, her loss %b
a heavy thing, a fetter in her chest. %b
Without her sheep, she stepped across the moss, %b
and there among the flowers took her rest, %b
alstroemeria and asters at her breast.
%p
Her sleep was restive as the evening turned %b
to dusk.  A dream apart, her body twitched %b
beneath the sky, beneath the air that burned %b
with things to come.  A shepherdess bewitched %b
by fairy-kind, she offered up herself, %b
an offer that was taken by the fae. %b
So, taken in her sleep, she bade farewell, %b
and found herself beneath the loam and clay, %b
in Cithriel, forever bound and held in sway.
%p
Young Floridel awoke on silk and down, %b
the guttering of the torches on the wall %b
illumination of the life she found %b
by chance, what came before leapt up to fall %b
on rocky shoals.  This hall, this fairy thing %b
her earth and sky, forever intertwined. %b
Oh, Cithriel - a name that ever sings %b
of desperate fate, of stress and two declines, %b
the future of its ruler and his queen-in-kind.
%p
As Floridel awoke, there was a knock, %b
a rap upon the gnarled and twisted door %b
awash with rings from ancient, rift-sawn oak %b
that wavered in the light above the floor. %b
A creak - a spindly girl beneath the frame, %b
a servant of the king-beneath-the-world. %b
She said, "I trust you slept?  I know you came %b
so far, as if a river sighed and purled %b
to bring you here, your future soon to be unfurled."
%p
The shepherd-girl lay still upon the bed, %b
her flaxen hair a mess of twigs and burrs, %b
of bits of moss - and once those words were said, %b
she shook her sleep, sat up, began to stir. %b
She focused on the torches' spit-and-crack, %b
and then upon the servant in the hall, %b
her mind in shock, and taken so aback %b
the hanging silence held there like a pall. %b
Her voice without, a songbird quelled and held enthralled -
%p
and brought back when the servant-girl procured %b
a splendid set of royal purple clothes %b
that caught the light with golden threads, secured %b
by sash and belt.  Perhaps one could suppose %b
cliche, these colours, such that every queen %b
and king have worn as symbols of their power. %b
To do so would dishonour what was seen %b
by all who stirred within that early hour: %b
sweet Floridel, this foreign and so lovely flower.
%p
For here she was; of course she'd heard the tales %b
from shepherd-folk, who told of seven years %b
they lost to merriment, with few details. %b
And sleep?  They spoke of music on the ear, %b
when resting on a high and stony mound. %b
Or glade.  Or underneath a stormy sky; %b
the claim from each of riders in the dark, %b
of silver laughter rustling in the rye. %b
A lover come to take them to embark %b
on journeys soon forgot, a steep and tumbling arc.
%p
She took the clothes.  She changed in open view, %b
and cast aside her tunic and her cloak, %b
naked, and for a moment such that few %b
had ever seen, for few have ever spoke %b
of beauty such as this: a willow tree %b
that bent down low to slip inside the dress. %b
And tying up the belt, she stopped to see %b
her image in a bowl, to first assess %b
herself as best as shallow water can express.
%p
A waver in the basin.  Hazy light. %b
A face that seemed to move, to look away, %b
her mind unsure the details looked quite right, %b
her memories seeming rimmed with dust, and grey, %b
the details left within the world above. %b
The contours of her mind felt thick, unclear %b
in recollection - all the things she loved, %b
her simple days - it felt as if a year %b
had passed to take her life before so far from here.
%p
She looked up from the bowl, and fixed her stare %b
towards the serving girl, who, with no name %b 
she knew, was like a mirror to her fair %b
complexion - darker hair, but still the same %b
in sense - anonymous within this space, %b
and seen, perhaps, but named by shamefully few. %b
But unlike Floridel, she had a place %b
that bound her here for life, a fact she knew %b
too well, a future fixed, and meek with servitude.
%p
So, Floridel was ready.  Through the door, %b
behind the silent servant, to the court. %b
She felt as if this instant should be more %b
than just an echo in the hall, a short %b
staccato.  Something else.  A precious thing %b
cupped tight within the hands, all green and gold %b
within the light.  A vireo, keen to sing %b
its ever-changing song, to ever hold %b
this moment so it's felt instead of merely tholed.
%p
She passed by lords and ladies to her side, %b
so tall and proud-eyed, splendid in their clothes %b
and well-groomed forms: she then increased her stride %b
to find the court, and for a minute, froze. %b
Impossibly, it seemed an endless room. %b
A trick of glamour?  Or, perhaps, a truth %b
left carved in stone, and vaulted like a tomb %b
to hold the wilting flower of her youth, %b
the meanings to be found with the hall abstruse.
%p
The ceiling held such strange and wondrous lights, %b
each chandelier an ancient beast, its eyes %b
aflame; and in the judgement of their height, %b
a bestiary cast upon the sky. %b
Their claws held torn the forms of ancient knights, %b
the gore a clutch of rubies in the air. %b
Though full of beauty, still by every right %b 
imagined blood, a ravaging laid bare, %b
the twisting of each face a gasping, dying stare.
%p
Below the lights, a sea of noble lords %b
and ladies, set in geometric rows %b
and patterns.  Everywhere, the glint of gold %b
on fingers, on the neck, a way to show %b
one's favour with the king.  For there he stood %b
upon a dais, by a birchwood throne %b
engraved with dragons deep within the wood. %b
Attention to their savagery was shown, %b
the hateful eyes as lifeless as a river stone.
%p
The king stood by his son and lovely queen. %b
The boy wore shining mail, and by his side, %b
an ancient fairy sword.  Its subtle sheen %b
belied that once it cut a titan wide %b
apart. And then the queen, so proud and tall, %b
a silver circlet perched upon her hair. %b
The spell she cast was palpable to all %b
that watched beneath the dancing lights.  The rare %b
sight of her was stunning: full and sweet and fair.
%p
A hush as Floridel walked in, and came %b
to stand before the retinue, alone. %b
For none within the court could ever feign %b
indifference, their pique and anger shown %b
by sidelong glances.  Whispers.  Every look %b
an accusation, but of what?  Her place? %b
She raised her eyes to meet Tel's own, and took %b
the rest the way a swimmer takes the waves, %b
embracing the nobility with calm and grace.
%p
And then, the sudden voice of Sel-the-King, %b
his baritone commanding silence in %b
the court.  Eyes dropped.  He said, "Today, we bring %b
an unling-child, a girl of earthly skin. %b
Let no one say we stole this shepherdess. %b
She slept upon the asters, on the knoll %b
we laid out for the willing.  Now she's blessed %b
to feast with us for seven years, to know %b
that time is all we're taking; seven years our toll."
%p
And then, he raised his hand.  The room a blur, %b
a feast was set, a thing to marvel at. %b
Each place was set with silver, goblets for %b
the wine.  Along the table, piglets, fat %b
and crackled.  Rainbow trout.  And berries, too, %b
for it is said the fairies love these best. %b
To trap the upland girl, the fair folk threw %b
the greatest feast they had, each one obsessed %b
to see if Floridel would fail or pass their test.
%p
She ate.  A fist of berries, then the wine, %b
the spice and honey heavy on her tongue. %b
An apple baked with cloves.  A snapper brined %b
in salt and sugar, plated high among %b
the sweet potatoes.  Candied plums.  A pie %b
with pecans hidden in the crust.  Her take %b
of food and drink had stilled the court, the sly %b
nobility enrapt with with how she slaked %b
her hunger on the fairy food and came awake.
%p
The room exhaled.  For this had been her out, %b
her way to push the fairy life away. %b
But when she broke their bread, she left no doubt %b
in all their minds.  She made the choice to stay, %b
to dwell with grace within the world below. %b
Now she was theirs.  The merriment began %b
in earnest as her hunger never slowed - %b
within a place like that, who could withstand %b
the painfully simple cunning of that fairy plan?
%p
She found, as if by magic, that she moved %b
towards the nobles seated at the head, %b
the king and queen.  And prince!  For Tel, unmoved %b
by all this revelry, watched her instead. %b
And past the drinking, past the lords she went - %b
her boldness shocked them all.  But there they were, %b
enchanted by the way in which she meant %b
to show her place, her new one, shepherd-girl %b
no more: she felt a change, a thing that shook and stirred.
%p
