Within the shrouds of myth, a kind of song %b
of lovers at the edges of the world, %b
their love accurs'd, a feeling held too strong %b
to keep the threads of fate from being purled %b
about them.  In the ancient woods so wild, %b
a pair whose love would ever grow and swell, %b
to make their names forever so reviled: %b
a man and woman caught beneath a spell, %b
the noble Tel and lovely lady Floridel.
%p
This story must begin before the birth %b
of Tel the King, the fated of the folk. %b
An augurer, they said, watched from the earth %b
and saw an eagle land on blighted oak. %b
"It must," she said, "be signal of a king, %b
a mighty man who yet has not been born - %b
whose will in later years will surely bring %b
his people to their knees, cast low and torn. %b
The Nine have willed this so, and so it must be sworn."
%p
And born he was, in fortress Cithriel, %b
the happy home, the fortress underground. %b
An ancient hall, a proper place to dwell %b
for kings and queens, and champions renowned. %b
So Tel the King was born to Sel and Shae, %b
good rulers, both, who kept a lengthy peace %b
between their kind and giants who in way %b
and deed sought war; sweet days would finally cease %b
when Tel raised sword in meddling Shiver's masterpiece.
%p
But first, he was a mewling, squealing babe, %b
with copper hair, and startling, sea-blue eyes - %b
a child who loved to run, but ever brave, %b
so fleet of foot, and quicker still to rise %b
to slights perceived, to all the things unsaid %b
but seen behind the veil of courtly grace. %b
For this was not a whelp who ever fled %b
the courtly hounds who lingered in that space - %b
the princeling made his presence felt within that place.
%p
And as the boy stepped boldly into youth, %b
above the hall, beside a reedy brook, %b
a shepherd-girl was born to simple truths: %b
to spring-time blooms, and laughter from the rook %b
that makes its spindly nest up in the boughs, %b
alight with all the colours of the wind. %b
Oh Floridel!  Who once was sweet, and now %b
your name is spoken thick with shame and sin - %b
the fledgeling turned, the evil goddess under skin.
%p
Surrounded by the presence of her sheep, %b
she learned to love each tiny lamb and ewe, %b
and then, one frigid spring, she learned to weep: %b
a stillborn lamb left stiff upon the dew. %b
And in this way, she wandered, year by year, %b
from quiet dells to wind-swept upland heaths %b
where ever with her flock she heard the clear %b
and present sounds, that cut with clarity %b
the stillness of the rich and green prosperity.
%p
And though austere to some, her life lacked none %b
for music, blown from flutes of hollow reeds, %b
whose simple notes sang soft beneath the sun, %b
hosannas to the earth that filled her needs. %b
Hosanna to the swiftly flowing water! %b
Hosanna to the oak that giveth shade! %b
Hosanna to the weather growing hotter! %b
Hosanna to the shelter of the glade! %b
Hosanna to the Lady and the things she made!
%p
For simple though it was, this life was good %b
and right.  A candle held against the world, %b
a spirit burning bright.  A symbol stood %b
in field and fen, this lovely shepherd-girl. %b
Held as she was within The Lady's arms %b
she soon would be so held within the hall %b
of Cithriel, and bound by all the charms %b
of fairy-kind, enrapt and held in thrall: %b
With Lady's loss, her love for Tel became her fall.
%p
The lovers met beneath a roiling sky. %b
A rider in the dawn, the noble Tel %b
astride a courser seeming as to fly %b
across the moor.  A hunt!  The horses swelled %b
and surged, to circle round the shepherd's flock. %b
Encircled by the lords, she never feared %b
for anything; she raised her voice to talk, %b
soprano free and lilting, high and clear %b
above the fray, a songbird's call upon the ear.
%p
"My name," she said with calm, "is Floridel. %b
I whither wander here upon these moors, %b
among the purple flowers, wherein I dwell %b
with sheep and lamb.  My life, I think, is pure. %b
I am she who weathers in the hills; %b
who sleeps among her sheep, and then beholds %b
the stars above that shine despite the chill; %b
who watches under weather harsh and cold; %b
a witness as the seasons say how life unfolds."
%p
And watching from the saddle of his horse, %b
the young man Tel, resplendent as the sun. %b
Intrigued, for all around, a show of force, %b
each horseman drunk with glory that he'd won %b
on hunt or battlefield, each armed with spear %b
across the back, and Floridel unmoved. %p
She met the king's own gaze, no trace of fear; %b
for, with no words, she knew that he approved. %b
Young Floridel, her mettle well and truly proved.
