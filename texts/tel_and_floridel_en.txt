I
%p
Within the shrouds of myth, a kind of song %b
of lovers at the edges of the world, %b
their love accurs'd, a feeling held too strong %b
to keep the threads of fate from being purled %b
about them.  In the ancient woods so wild, %b
a pair whose love would ever grow and swell, %b
to make their names forever so reviled: %b
a man and woman caught beneath a spell, %b
the noble Tel and lovely lady Floridel.
%p
This story must begin before the birth %b
of Tel the King, the fated of the folk. %b
An augurer, they said, watched from the earth %b
and saw an eagle land on blighted oak. %b
"It must," she said, "be signal of a king, %b
a mighty man who yet has not been born - %b
whose will in later years will surely bring %b
his people to their knees, cast low and torn. %b
The Nine have willed this so, and so it must be sworn."
%p
And born he was, in fortress Cithriel, %b
the happy home, the fortress underground. %b
An ancient hall, a proper place to dwell %b
for kings and queens, and champions renowned. %b
So Tel the King was born to Sel and Shae, %b
good rulers, both, who kept a lengthy peace %b
between their kind and giants who in way %b
and deed sought war; sweet days would finally cease %b
when hubris would touch off the tragic masterpiece.
%p
But first, he was a mewling, squealing babe, %b
with copper hair, and startling, sea-blue eyes - %b
a child who loved to run, but ever brave, %b
so fleet of foot, and quicker still to rise %b
to slights perceived, to all the things unsaid %b
but seen behind the veil of courtly grace. %b
For this was not a whelp who ever fled %b
the courtly hounds who lingered in that space - %b
the princeling made his presence felt within that place.
%p
And as the boy stepped boldly into youth, %b
above the hall, beside a reedy brook, %b
a shepherd-girl was born to simple truths: %b
to spring-time blooms, and laughter from the rook %b
that makes its spindly nest up in the boughs, %b
alight with all the colours of the wind. %b
Oh Floridel!  You were so sweet, and now %b
your name hangs heavy, thick with shame and sin - %b
a fledgling framed for knotting what was Tel's own skein.
%p
Surrounded by the presence of her sheep, %b
she learned to love each tiny lamb and ewe, %b
and then, one frigid spring, she learned to weep: %b
a stillborn lamb left stiff upon the dew. %b
And in this way, she wandered, year by year, %b
from quiet dells to wind-swept upland heaths %b
where ever with her flock she heard the clear %b
and present sounds, that cut with clarity %b
the stillness of the rich and green prosperity.
%p
And though austere to some, her life lacked none %b
for music, blown from flutes of hollow reeds, %b
whose simple notes sang soft beneath the sun, %b
hosannas to the earth that filled her needs. %b
Hosanna to the swiftly flowing water! %b
Hosanna to the oak that giveth shade! %b
Hosanna to the weather growing hotter! %b
Hosanna to the shelter of the glade! %b
Hosanna to the Lady and the things she made!
%p
For simple though it was, this life was good %b
and right.  A candle held against the world, %b
a spirit burning bright.  A symbol stood %b
in field and fen, this lovely shepherd-girl. %b
Held as she was within The Lady's arms %b
she soon would be so held within the hall %b
of Cithriel, and bound by all the charms %b
of fairy-kind, enrapt and held in thrall: %b
With Lady's loss, her love for Tel became her fall.
%p
The lovers met beneath a roiling sky. %b
A rider in the dawn, the noble Tel %b
astride a courser seeming as to fly %b
across the moor.  A hunt!  The horses swelled %b
and surged, to circle round the shepherd's flock. %b
Encircled by the lords, she never feared %b
for anything; she raised her voice to talk, %b
soprano free and lilting, high and clear %b
above the fray, a songbird's call upon the ear.
%p
"My name," she said with calm, "is Floridel. %b
I whither wander here upon these moors, %b
among the purple flowers, wherein I dwell %b
with sheep and lamb.  My life, I think, is pure. %b
For I am she who weathers in the hills; %b
who sleeps among her sheep, and then beholds %b
the stars above that shine despite the chill; %b
who watches under weather harsh and cold; %b
a witness as the seasons say how life unfolds."
%p
And watching from the saddle of his horse, %b
the young man Tel, resplendent as the sun. %b
Intrigued, for all around, a show of force, %b
each horseman drunk with glory that he'd won %b
on hunt or battlefield, each armed with spear %b
across the back, and Floridel unmoved. %b
She met the princeling's gaze, no trace of fear; %b
for, with no words, she knew that he approved. %b
Young Floridel, her mettle well and truly proved.
%p
He paused but for a moment; then he spoke, %b
"I've never met a person such as you - %b
who sees beneath the raiment and the cloak, %b
to speak her words so clear, to cut right through %b
the skein-and-tangle of my noble life. %b
Won't you come with me?  Beneath the earth %b
to Cithriel, our hall, forever rife %b
with feasting and with fill, a place of worth %b
where fairy-kind forever flits with joy and mirth."
%p
She let the words between them cut the air %b
to fall among the flowers on the ground, %b
and pausing for a moment, stopped to stare %b
at cowslips, flowering crimson, that she found %b
about her feet.  A kind of final gift %b
upon the moor.  A fairy ring of sorts, %b
and so she said, "The world is ever swift %b
to say what should be done.  And so, report %b
that in a week I'll join you in your fairy court."
%p
Her answer given, Floridel went west. %b
She took her flock and wandered for three days, %b
until she found a valley, green and blessed %b
with icy streams.  And then, she made her way %b
alone across the moor.  She wept, her loss %b
a heavy thing, a fetter in her chest. %b
Without her sheep, she stepped across the moss, %b
and there among the flowers took her rest, %b
alstroemeria and asters at her breast.
%p
Her sleep was restive as the evening turned %b
to dusk.  A dream apart, her body twitched %b
beneath the sky, beneath the air that burned %b
with things to come.  A shepherdess bewitched %b
by fairy-kind, she offered up herself, %b
an offer that was taken by the fae. %b
So, taken in her sleep, she bade farewell, %b
and found herself beneath the loam and clay, %b
in Cithriel, forever bound and held in sway.
%p
Young Floridel awoke on silk and down, %b
the guttering of the torches on the wall %b
illumination of the life she found %b
by chance, what came before leapt up to fall %b
on rocky shoals.  This hall, this fairy thing %b
her earth and sky, forever intertwined. %b
Oh, Cithriel - a name that ever sings %b
of desperate fate, of stress and two declines, %b
the future of its ruler and his queen-in-kind.
%p
As Floridel awoke, there was a knock, %b
a rap upon the gnarled and twisted door %b
awash with rings from ancient, rift-sawn oak %b
that wavered in the light above the floor. %b
A creak - a spindly girl beneath the frame, %b
a servant of the king-beneath-the-world. %b
She said, "I trust you slept?  I know you came %b
so far, as if a river sighed and purled %b
to bring you here, your future soon to be unfurled."
%p
The shepherd-girl lay still upon the bed, %b
her flaxen hair a mess of twigs and burrs, %b
of bits of moss - and once those words were said, %b
she shook her sleep, sat up, began to stir. %b
She focused on the torches' spit-and-crack, %b
and then upon the servant in the hall, %b
her mind in shock, and taken so aback %b
the hanging silence held there like a pall. %b
Her voice without, a songbird quelled and held enthralled -
%p
and brought back when the servant-girl procured %b
a splendid set of royal purple clothes %b
that caught the light with golden threads, secured %b
by sash and belt.  Perhaps one could suppose %b
cliche, these colours, such that every queen %b
and king have worn as symbols of their power. %b
To do so would dishonour what was seen %b
by all who stirred within that early hour: %b
sweet Floridel, this foreign and so lovely flower.
%p
For here she was; of course she'd heard the tales %b
from shepherd-folk, who told of seven years %b
they lost to merriment, with few details. %b
And sleep?  They spoke of music on the ear, %b
when resting on a high and stony mound. %b
Or glade.  Or underneath a stormy sky; %b
the claim from each of riders in the dark, %b
of silver laughter rustling in the rye. %b
A lover come to take them to embark %b
on journeys soon forgot, a steep and tumbling arc.
%p
She took the clothes.  She changed in open view, %b
and cast aside her tunic and her cloak, %b
naked, and for a moment such that few %b
had ever seen, for few have ever spoke %b
of beauty such as this: a willow tree %b
that bent down low to slip inside the dress. %b
And tying up the belt, she stopped to see %b
her image in a bowl, to first assess %b
herself as best as shallow water can express.
%p
A waver in the basin.  Hazy light. %b
A face that seemed to move, to look away, %b
her mind unsure the details looked quite right, %b
her memories seeming rimmed with dust, and grey, %b
the details left within the world above. %b
The contours of her mind felt thick, unclear %b
in recollection - all the things she loved, %b
her simple days - it felt as if a year %b
had passed to take her life before so far from here.
%p
She looked up from the bowl, and fixed her stare %b
towards the serving girl, who, with no name %b 
she knew, was like a mirror to her fair %b
complexion - darker hair, but still the same %b
in sense - anonymous within this space, %b
and seen, perhaps, but named by shamefully few. %b
But unlike Floridel, she had a place %b
that bound her here for life, a fact she knew %b
too well, a future fixed, and meek with servitude.
%p
So, Floridel was ready.  Through the door, %b
behind the silent servant, to the court. %b
She felt as if this instant should be more %b
than just an echo in the hall, a short %b
staccato.  Something else.  A precious thing %b
cupped tight within the hands, all green and gold %b
within the light.  A vireo, keen to sing %b
its ever-changing song, to ever hold %b
this moment so it's felt instead of merely tholed.
%p
She passed by lords and ladies to her side, %b
so tall and proud-eyed, splendid in their clothes %b
and well-groomed forms: she then increased her stride %b
to find the court, and for a minute, froze. %b
Impossibly, it seemed an endless room. %b
A trick of glamour?  Or, perhaps, a truth %b
left carved in stone, and vaulted like a tomb %b
to hold the wilting flower of her youth, %b
the meanings to be found with the hall abstruse.
%p
The ceiling held such strange and wondrous lights, %b
each chandelier an ancient beast, its eyes %b
aflame; and in the judgement of their height, %b
a bestiary cast upon the sky. %b
Their claws held torn the forms of ancient knights, %b
the gore a clutch of rubies in the air. %b
Though full of beauty, still by every right %b 
imagined blood, a ravaging laid bare, %b
the twisting of each face a gasping, dying stare.
%p
Below the lights, a sea of noble lords %b
and ladies, set in geometric rows %b
and patterns.  Everywhere, the glint of gold %b
on fingers, on the neck, a way to show %b
one's favour with the king.  For there he stood %b
upon a dais, by a birchwood throne %b
engraved with dragons deep within the wood. %b
Attention to their savagery was shown, %b
the hateful eyes as lifeless as a river stone.
%p
The king stood by his son and lovely queen. %b
The boy wore shining mail, and by his side, %b
an ancient fairy sword.  Its subtle sheen %b
belied that once it cut a titan wide %b
apart. And then the queen, so proud and tall, %b
a silver circlet perched upon her hair. %b
The spell she cast was palpable to all %b
that watched beneath the dancing lights.  The rare %b
sight of her was stunning: full and sweet and fair.
%p
A hush as Floridel walked in, and came %b
to stand before the retinue, alone. %b
For none within the court could ever feign %b
indifference, their pique and anger shown %b
by sidelong glances.  Whispers.  Every look %b
an accusation, but of what?  Her place? %b
She raised her eyes to meet Tel's own, and took %b
the rest the way a swimmer takes the waves, %b
embracing the nobility with calm and grace.
%p
And then, the sudden voice of Sel-the-King, %b
his baritone commanding silence in %b
the court.  Eyes dropped.  He said, "Today, we bring %b
an unling-child, a girl of earthly skin. %b
Let no one say we stole this shepherdess. %b
She slept upon the asters, on the knoll %b
we laid out for the willing.  Now she's blessed %b
to feast with us for seven years, to know %b
that time is all we're taking; seven years our toll."
%p
And then, he raised his hand.  The room a blur, %b
a feast was set, a thing to marvel at. %b
Each place was set with silver, goblets for %b
the wine.  Along the table, piglets, fat %b
and crackled.  Rainbow trout.  And berries, too, %b
for it is said the fairies love these best. %b
To trap the upland girl, the fair folk threw %b
the greatest feast they had, each one obsessed %b
to see if Floridel would fail or pass their test.
%p
She ate.  A fist of berries, then the wine, %b
the spice and honey heavy on her tongue. %b
An apple baked with cloves.  A snapper brined %b
in salt and sugar, plated high among %b
the sweet potatoes.  Candied plums.  A pie %b
with pecans hidden in the crust.  Her take %b
of food and drink had stilled the court, the sly %b
nobility enrapt with with how she slaked %b
her hunger on the fairy food and came awake.
%p
The room exhaled.  For this had been her out, %b
her way to push the fairy life away. %b
But when she broke their bread, she left no doubt %b
in all their minds.  She made the choice to stay, %b
to dwell with grace within the world below. %b
Now she was theirs.  The merriment began %b
in earnest as her hunger never slowed - %b
within a place like that, who could withstand %b
the painfully simple cunning of that fairy plan?
%p
She found, as if by magic, that she moved %b
towards the nobles seated at the head, %b
the king and queen.  And prince!  For Tel, unmoved %b
by all this revelry, watched her instead. %b
And past the drinking, past the lords she went - %b
her boldness shocked them all.  But there they were, %b
enchanted by the way in which she meant %b
to show her place, her new one, shepherd-girl %b
no more: she felt a change, a thing that shook and stirred.
%p
A sense that now their lives were bound in fate, %b 
entwined within some kind of cosmic play. %b
Despite this, though, she felt the feeling late, %b
once all the stars had gone and had their say. %b
My life will never be, she thought, as good %b
as all the feasting laid about tonight. %b
A consort unaccepted - if I should %b
falter, or if I quaver from their slights, %b
then give me strength to shine against the coming night. 
%P 
II
%p
So by and by, the young girl passed the days %b
enrapt within the stacks, the ancient tomes %b
the fae preserved; for still, the wise men say %b
that fairy folk was learning's ancient home: %b
in Calasim, a library down below %b
the ancient halls of Cithriel, a stone %b
and paper fortress, alluded to, and shown %b
in bits and scraps: in books, in scrolls and koans, %b
the greatest trove of knowledge man had ever known.
%p
By day, she shadowed Tel, an unling child %b
who felt the murmurs of her earthly birth %b
each time she passed the cracking, painted smile %b
of lord or lady; still, she knew her worth, %b
that Tel had chosen her and her alone. %b
And as the others drank into the night, %b
she crept into the stacks, and on her own %b
she learned the runic script, the songs and rites %b
that danced across the page and fluttered in the light.
%p
But books were not for Tel.  He knew his place %b
was on the throne, a prince who soon would rule %b
the hidden world.  He learned to fight with grace, %b
elan, to work his howling sword with cruel %b
intensity.  To give and then to take. %b
His father, Sel, made peace with giant-kind. %b
Between the titan-kin and wilful fae, %b
a peace maintained for generations, blind %b
to hubris and the way it has its own designs.
%p
A precious thing, his father's fragile peace. %b
The stopper of a thousand years of war, %b
it spoke of better times; if not, at least %b
for grass to grow upon the upland moors %b
that held within their hills a mass of bones. %b
Beneath, the mouthless voices of the dead. %b
The nameless men, who with their sigh and moan %b
lay bare their ending: fatted, armed and bled %b
with promises of glory heaped on kings instead.
%p
And Tel was young, and keen to earn his fame. %b
Each morning he took lessons with the knights, %b
the hardened men who fought and won their names %b
while comrades fell, impaled, and felt the light %b
fade.  Later, tactics.  How to lead his men %b
on horse, on foot, through hills or open field. %b
To pass unseen through woodlands, heath and fens. %b
To find the ambush points within a weald. %b
To come like hidden death, to bite and never yield.
%p
If only it were practice, not the way %b
that men approach the world.  That in those halls %b
the swords were show, and never used to prey %b
on weaker things: the frightened peasant mauled %b
and left to die, the entrails in his hands %b
a sickly mess, no way to keep them in; %b
the folk whose fault is just to work the land %b
in places that are coveted by kings. %b
For where there's want, it's sure the sword is what they'll bring.
%p
It's said that in the ages of the world, %b
the fairy folk were first; were that the case, %b
who built the ancient temples, high, unfurled %b
like banners from the sky?  I hear that race %b
of builders passed like sound.  So too the beasts %b
that live in myth.  The nimble, copper birds. %b
The creatures of the ancient woods, not least %b
of all the golden hart.  Unseen, unheard, %b
the mighty stag a call to any man who dared.
%p
The princeling heard the stories as a child: %b
the stag-that-fled-the-day, its golden hide %b
alight beneath the brilliance of the wild %b
blue mornings.  Fleeting.  Eager in its stride, %b
an echo of a magic come and gone %b
when things were new, the firmament unclear %b
and cooling fast, the rules and lines undrawn %b
within the world.  A great and tragic deer. %b
A vestige of an era soon to disappear.
%p
One morning, as the sunrise broke the moors, %b
the fae prepared to take a feasting day. %b
The king and all his company ensured %b
their table never lacked for meat.  They say %b
that ancient folk loved boar; and not the pigs %b
who wallow down in shaky wooden sties, %b
but massive things whose tusks could crack the ribs %b
of lesser men, eviscerate them dry, %b
and leave their bodies underneath the callow sky.
%p
Sel took his son and seven trusted men %b
to ride the world above.  Unpleasant clouds %b
hung low.  They seemed to scrape the ground, and when %b
they moved, the hue and pall were like a shroud %b
pulled loose.  The riders sent a scout ahead %b
to suss the woodland paths, and then to call %b
by horn.  A fourth, a fifth - with quarry spread %b
across a stretch of scraggly wood, the small %b
and humble hunt betrayed the coming of a squall.
%p
The comitatus swept into the trees, %b
with each of them pursuing in that scrag %b
the hoped-for boar.  Behind was Tel, and he %b
was inexperienced.  He caught a snag, %b
the branches reaching in towards his cloak, %b
and causing him to catch.  He flipped around, %b
his body arched and tumbling.  Wildflowers broke %b
his fall.  A sea a hundred yards around, %b
it saved him, like by magic, as he hit the ground.
%p
No rocks, no roots, no hard, uneven soil - %b
the princeling lay within the gentle flowers, %b
and watched the mist above him teem and roil. %b
The sun obscured, uncertain of the hour, %b
it seemed to Tel that something in the haze %b
stood still.  A glint.  A glimmer.  Hint of gold %b
and muscle.  Then, it turned and held his gaze. %b
The deer!  A thing of magic in the cold %b
grey morning, proud and wondrous, grim and hale and bold.
%p
When deer and Tel locked eyes, the prince was struck %b
by how the unassuming creature stood - %b
a loose and easy confidence, that buck. %b
Its antlers caught the light, and if it could %b 
just speak, then it would surely voice disdain %b
toward the stripling, winded in his bower %b
beneath a mountain ash.  The fairy thane %b
stood up.  He drew his bow with all his power, %b
and sent an arrow shrieking in that morning hour.
%p
The arrow arced by magic, seemed to float, %b
meander through the trees, and disappear. %b
The stag raised up its head, and shook its coat. %b
A sheen of something human in that deer, %b
a throaty kind of laugh, a knowing glance %b
toward the gobsmacked prince.  A sudden roar %b
from somewhere in the distance, that expanse %b
of dying brush, the hart now gone: before %b
the prince, the kind of test that he'd been dying for.
%p
He heard the thing before he saw it.  Thrum - %b
reverberating, hanging in the air, %b
an echo in the woods, a warning.  Thrum - %b
a heavy beat, a drum-shot, deep and spare. %b
The leaves and flowers bent down softly.  Thrum - %b
now closer, louder.  Trembling in the sway %b
of alder branches, slender starlings.  Thrum %b
and crash!  The woods themselves in disarray: %b
a giant roared and raised his blade towards the fae.
%p
As high up on a mountain, bits of rock %b
fall loose and tumble down, increasing speed %b
and fury, so the massive giant shocked %b
the prince.  A force of hell, it tore the trees %b
apart, but staggered, arrow in the eye - %b
that shot that wove by magic past the deer %b
had caught the towering hunter by surprise. %b
The thing was dying - arrow sunk and pierced %b
his brain, and yet his judgement, full of hate, was clear.
%p
A seventeen-foot blade, a cleaver forged %b
with breathless skill, the massive sword smashed through %b
the brittle trunks like matchwood.  Bit and gorged %b
on starlings.  Shook the earth.  The princeling knew %b
that blade meant death.  He feinted left and rolled %b
into a slough, a reedy, dried up ditch. %b
He grabbed his horn, and from his lips he tolled %b
a single note and held it, something which %b
he knew would call the riders to this roll and pitch.
%p
But as the note was blown, the sword crashed down. %b
He scurried left, and choked as grit and dust %b
exploded in the air.  He felt he'd drown %b
within that sea.  He tasted earth and must. %b
And then he felt his sword within his hand. %b
The warmth within the hilt, the singing blade, %b
the way it caught the light - he'd make his stand %b
within this narrow ditch, this reedy glade, %b
a princeling overmatched, but grim and unafraid.
%p
The giant turned to raise his blade again, %b
but Tel was far too quick.  He leapt and swung. %b
A flash of silver, then a roar of pain - %b
the stroke had caught the ankle, and then sprung %b
an artery.  The hobbled creature sprayed %b
and screamed, and as it did, the willows shied, %b
the tallgrass bending low as if to pray %b
to be released from fury amplified %b
by ankle bones laid bare and tendons slashed aside.
%p
Unsteady, now, the giant snarled with hate: %b
"You petty thing, you gnome-beneath-the-earth, %b
you thought that magic deer would be your fate? %b
You'd shoot it dead, its hide to show your worth %b
within your court?  You fool.  Your actions reek %b
of pride and ruin, your hubris shining bright %b
as dragon-gold.  I swear my sword will seek %b
an ending, both of you and all your knights: %b
I'll have it said that Choro stood and made his fight."
%p
For as he spoke, the tell-tale sound of hooves - %b
the king and riders heard the note, and came %b
like ghosts upon their mounts.  The dry grass moved %b
to part.  Beneath the clouds, the weather waned %b
to cold, a frost now settling on their arms %b
and mail.  A fairy ring, a circle formed %b
to keep the fairy prince from ill and harm. %b
Each rider knew the task he must perform: %b
to shelter king and son within the coming storm.
%p
The giant roared.  He spun his sword, and hurled %b
it at the ground.  So by design, it bounced %b
and cut apart three loyal men.  It twirled %b
the guts and sinew high and wide, announced %b
with certainty that hard-fought peace was dead. %b
That blade killed Col, the councillor to the king; %b
and Brin, and Ran, two huntsman who instead %b
would feast no more.  Sel let his sabre sing %b
and galloped down to make a bloody offering.
%p
He charged with speed, a rider at each side. %b
The three of them rode hard, and dug their spurs %b
in tight, assured that this must turn the tide: %b
a royal charge, the kind of noble corps %b
the poets love, that sound the lutes and harps %b
when told by torchlight in the warmth of halls %b
on winter nights.  Here now the king, his sharp %b
and singing sword; here now the spit and squall, %b
a clash to cut and rend, to crush and tear and maul.
%p
Sometimes the songs are wrong.  Sometimes they lie %b
in wait, an adder in the reeds.  Sometimes %b
they shriek and break apart.  Sometimes they shy %b
away, betray a stumble in their rhymes. %b
Sometimes they close the shutters; in the hearth, %b
a smell of something burning, smoke and lye. %b
Sometimes they cling and hold like dampened earth, %b
the way a rotting body sticks to lime. %b
Sometimes the falsehoods sweeten, harden, ossify.
%p
When lauding dying kings, the minstrels say, %b
"His end was gentle, glorious his reign." %b
They never speak of violence, of the way %b
he bled to death, or how his guts and brains %b
were splayed across the earth.  When Choros caught %b
the king, he brought a branch across his face %b
with so much strength, it seemed as if it ought %b
to pry his head apart.  An ugly fate, %b
a sick and bloody end for such a man of grace.
%p
The king went tumbling hard, and hit the ground. %b
His face a fleshy pulp, he gurgled out %b
a name that mixed with bits of teeth, a sound %b
like "Shae".  Convulsions.  Every cough a spout %b
of blood.  Then silence.  Oh, how Choros roared! %b
It shook the glade, his club a clotted mess: %b
the twice-crowned king, the fallen fairy lord %b
was dead.  With that momentum repossessed, %b
the wounded giant raised his club to meet the rest.
%p
"Devil!"  A ringing cri de coeur from Tel, %b
who dug his heels and sent his courser wild. %b
He raised his sword to signal coming hell, %b
and then, without a word, began to ride. %b
The fallen king's two riders circled round. %b
The strongest knight, Ilar, was struck and crashed %b
down hard.  His body hit the rocky ground, %b
his plate-mail seeping.  But the other flashed %b
his sabre by the giant's wrist, began to slash -
%p
The blade hit skin, then muscle, blood, and bone. %b
He missed the wrist, but caught the forearm flush %b
and cut it cleanly.  He could not atone %b
for having failed his king, perhaps to rush %b
ahead, and take the blow instead - but this %b
was something.  Comfort?  No.  But something, still. %b
Emboldened, any lingering fear dismissed, %b
the new king and his riders in the chill %b
of morning rode towards the giant for the kill.
%p
They hacked and hewed.  The giant stood no chance, %b
his good arm gone, his ankle slashed to threads. %b
He dodged a blade, but faltered.  In that stance, %b
uncertain in the outcome, in his legs, %b
perhaps in how the bards would sing his name. %b
But Choros was committed.  Did he not %b
just fell the fairy king?  Well, now the same %b
would be their fate.  The minstrels say he fought %b
ferociously, his very life an afterthought.
%p
The fairy knight that took his arm came round. %b
His sabre flashed, impaled the giant's side, %b
but Choros held the rider's arm, and bound %b
the man to him.  Dislodged the blade.  A cry %b
as giant slowly ran the sword through mail, %b
and up and through the windpipe.  Brittle air: %b
the gasps were lost as Choros faced a hail %b
of blows, the riders on him.  Everywhere %b
a blade, a spear, the giant falling, dying there.
%p
A shudder, then the darkness took his eyes. %b
The three men paused to catch their breath, and scan %b
the carnage.  Underneath the steel-grey sky, %b
their former king and five good men began %b
to cool.  And in the air, a chill, a sense %b
that peace had come and gone.  Ephemeral. %b
The days when folk could live their lives content, %b
a moment in the past made visceral. %b
A songbird in the morning, longed-for, temporal.
%p
Tel cleaned his sword on speargrass, raised his voice, %b
and spoke.  "I never thought that I would be %b
made king this way.  For if it were my choice, %b
I'd spend my life in happy waiting, free %b
to hold my aging father in my arms. %b
What stars could ever cast aside this man, %b
this man of men, this king who would disarm %b
the world?  So hear me, now, and understand - %b
we'll never see his like again within this land."
%p
That evening, Tel's men headed north for wood %b
to build a pyre, and let him come to grief. %b
He knelt before his father, understood %b
that soon he'd draw the spirit out with leaves %b
and logs, a bed to lay the king-that-was %b
to sleep.  A beacon in the night.  They built %b
a crossing-bridge beneath the corpse.  Paused %b
to say some words.  Tel lit the base, and felt %b
a rush of anguish as he watched the body melt.
%p
The company returned, an empty hall %b
their welcome home.  The silver had been set, %b
amphorae placed, but absence is the pall %b
of merriment.  They poured some wine, and wept. %b
The clamour roused the sleepers.  Lanterns lit. %b
Now all around the hall were laughs, delight %b
the king had come - at last!  And bit by bit, %b
subsided, as no glamour could disguise %b
the heavy dwindling, the losses realized.
%p
The silence as the widow-queen arrived %b
descended on the room, as if the air %b
itself proclaimed the news: her son alive, %b
her husband gone.  The grief she wore was bare %b
and evident, her lovely face now gaunt, %b
her skin stretched thin where once her happy smile %b
had charmed them all.  This fated hunt would haunt %b
her waning days; a sudden, sick surprise, %b
as when one digs and finds a buried, broken child.
%p
She said, "My darling son - I waited well %b
into the night, drank tea until the dregs %b
ran cold.  I felt it when your father fell. %b
I felt him go, and heard his spirit tread %b
to find the world beyond, below that lake %b
that beckons blue-and-black.  His wayward soul %b
will find its rest: beneath the silt and slate, %b
in fields of asphodel, there is a knoll; %b
and lying there, the only man who made me whole."
%p
With anguish in her eyes, she looked away. %b
A servant wrapped her shoulders in a shawl; %b
then looking up, she stopped, as if to say %b
something, but caught herself.  A senechal, %b
an older man in black, gave up his arm %b
and led her to her quarters, where the bleak, %b
unfiltered truth of loss would come to form %b
her narrative, her turn from strong to weak. %b
And as she left, her battered son began to speak.
%p 
"I come to you in great humility. %b
The great king Sel, the maker of our peace, %b
is dead; so too the credibility %b
of truce.  For in the ancient woods, I loosed %b
an arrow at the golden hart.  It veered %b
so swiftly.  What but magic could have claimed %b
the course?  The shot was swift and true - a spear %b
that caught a giant, split his eye, and maimed %b
the bladed beast: enraged and bloodied, wild, untamed."
%p
"I called them with my horn, those noble men %b
of Cithriel, but this was not a day %b
for bloodless glory.  Riding down the glen, %b
my father felt his spirit fade away %b
when caught across the face - an aspen trunk, %b
as nimble as a rod in giant hands. %b
We slew the beast, then made a pyre from hunks %b
of knotted oak, a boat built high and grand %b
to sail my father deep into the quiet land."
%p
As Tel was speaking, Floridel emerged %b
to stand before the crowd.  Though all the lords %b
and ladies watched, she never felt the urge %b
to wilt.  Their knowing stares might underscore %b
that these were not her folk, but he was hers. %b
Her fairy king.  Her rider on the moor. %b
He'd stolen her away; she'd not demur %b
to any courtesan.  So, tall and pure, %b
she spoke, her voice commanding, high and proud and sure.
%p
"The peaceful days we've loved," she said, "will change. %b
I know of giant-kind.  They're neither cruel %b
nor merciful, but strong, and have a strange %b
and keen intelligence.  We would be fools %b
to think our merriment will carry through %b
the coming night with darker days in store. %b
So light the fires, and take up arms - eschew %b
the pleasantries, and face the jaws of war! %b
For only then we'll find the things worth dying for."
%p
A murmur as the fickle crowd approved %b
the fire of Floridel.  Here was a girl %b
they knew was not their own, and yet still moved %b
and spoke as fairy-kind.  Whose grace and snarl %b
was startling.  This was no shepherdess %b
who sat by oaten reeds and watched the wolves %b
devour her flock.  And as the queen addressed %b
the hall, the people sensed a sudden pull, %b
their fate careening, tumbling, irreversible.
%p
III
%p
A longhouse built of greystone, walled by tusks %b
of conquered mastodons, the giant hall %b
called Farstead stood and watched the coming dusk. %b
Its stones were massive, finely cut, and hauled %b
from lowland quarries through the winding plains %b
whose grasses sway and shiver.  Up towards %b
the central gate a pair of figures came, %b
exhausted, but their faces set and hard, %b
and in their arms, a body and a massive sword.
%p
The taller of the two threw down the blade. %b
It clattered on the rocky, fallow earth, %b
announced to both the sentries at the gate %b
that now the feast was done.  So too the mirth %b
of those that drank within: a sudden shout %b
brought men and women rushing, armed and mailed. %b
They fixed their helmets, grabbed at spears, stepped out %b
into the autumn air.  This day would hail %b
a terrifying war; the hope of peace had failed.
%p
A parting in the crowd.  Throughout the throng %b
of able fighters came their warchief.  Known %b
as death in battle, he'd been serving long %b
enough to stitch his armour with the bones %b
of those he'd fought and felled.  He understood %b
the way to split and hew, to show the fae %b
he wasn't some mere trifle in the woods. %b
He'd cleave the earth and any in his way: %b
Arkadios, the champion, would have his say.
%p
"Brave Choros!" roared Arkadios.  "I'll see %b
your death avenged a thousand fold.  I swear %b
I'll bring the fair folk low, and make them plead %b
for mercy I don't have.  I'll lay them bare! %b
I loathe those gussied, gilded fops - they make %b
a hard-fought peace, and break it just as fast. %b
They'll die beneath my axe, and if it slakes %b
my grief, then may you find some rest at last. %b
So let us mourn our brother; now the die is cast."
%p
Held crooked beneath his arm, a monstrous helm %b
of ancient silver.  Not the king's demand %b
for torques and rings, whose shimmer overwhelms, %b
but rarer, built up as the world began %b
to take its shape, an alloy hard as steel. %b
The mask was like a dragon's face, so when %b
he placed the helmet on his head, the feel %b
was real: a giant for a moment, then %b
appearing as a creature from the darkest fens.
%p
He stormed into the guardhouse for his axe - %b
taboo to bring one's weapons in the hall - %b
and found that cleaver propped within the racks %b
of lesser soldiers' halberds, swords, and mauls. %b
A jagged edge, a wicked, arcing curve, %b
and written in the metal was its name. %b
They called it Blood and Glory, I have heard. %b
Its forger was a smith of much acclaim - %b
an artist in his craft, a servant of the flame.
%p
He snarled, "So which of you now standing here %b
will help avenge his death?  And which of you %b
want blood, but also keep a mind as clear %b
as fresh-burnt woods?  I have no truck, no use %b
for those whose deeds are timorous and meek. %b
We'll ride in like a storm comes off the sea: %b
pent up, raging.  Let them say we reek %b
of blood and lust for death.  I swear we'll see %b
an end to all this prattle on the fae mystique."
%p
Two figures pushed the other folk aside. %b
The first, a slender creature, flashed a smile %b
that glinted like a brace of open knives. %b
The other one was thick and scarred, a vile, %b
unpleasant man known mainly for his acts %b
of sex and violence carried out on raids %b
along the coast.  "Arkadios!  A pact!" %b
the slender one proclaimed.  "Before this day %b
is done we'll drain the bathers in their sacred glade."
%p
A shudder shook the crowd, for each one knew %b
the fair folk's virgin girls would come to bathe %b
tomorrow in a copse of elm and yew - %b
a warm spring bubbled there, and people say %b
that place was sacred ground for gods and men. %b
That there the first folk sacrificed at night, %b
beneath the sprawling heavens, when, it's said, %b
the world was strange and new.  And now, alight: %b
with spit and crackle, kindling catching, burning bright.
%p
Arkadios just nodded.  "There are times %b
when people cast civility aside. %b
I feel that your suggestion will define %b
this war.  I'll have no talk of it, of lines %b
we cannot cross: there's victory, or else %b
there's total loss.  We'll let their bodies lie %b
like offerings, laid out to bleed in rows %b
or simply left to rot.  Beneath the sky, %b
we'll stack them four feet up.  So let the crows %b
and buzzards salivate - we'll feed them as we go."
%p
