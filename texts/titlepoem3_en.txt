The faery beam upon you! %b
The stars to glisten on you! %b
A moon of light %b
In the noon of night %b
Till the fire-drake hath o'ergone you! %b
The wheel of Fortune guide you! %b
The Boy with the bow beside you %b
Run aye in the way %b
Till the bird of day %b
And the luckier lot betide you!
%p
- Ben Jonson, "Gypsy Songs", I %b
