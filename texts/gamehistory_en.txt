Shadow of the Wyrm, nee Savage Lands, started as a side-project in July, 2011.  Development was originally done with gcc/MinGW and a local Subversion server, before switching in early 2012 to Visual Studio and a Mercurial repository hosted at Bitbucket.
%p
The first release, as Savage Lands, was on August 31, 2015.  A re-release the next day (under the final name, Shadow of the Wyrm) was required due to a naming collision with another fantasy game with the same name.

For years, Brian Jeffears nudged me to write music for the game.  It's thanks to him and people from the roguelikes Discord that I finally took that off my long-term to do list.  I owe each person who's pushed me on this a debt of gratitude for making the game that much more immersive and real.

Localizations take a large amount of time and effort.  The Russian localization of an early version of the game was provided by Redfeek.

Finally, SDL support wouldn't be possible without the excellent help and advice provided by people in #roguelike-help on the roguelikes Discord server - HexDecimal, Stof, Smartledore, and others.
