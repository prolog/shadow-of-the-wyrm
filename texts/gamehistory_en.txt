Shadow of the Wyrm, nee Savage Lands, started as a side-project in July, 2011.  Development was originally done with gcc/MinGW and a local Subversion server, before switching in early 2012 to Visual Studio and a Mercurial repository hosted at Bitbucket.

The first release, as Savage Lands, was on August 31, 2015.  A re-release the next day (under the final name, Shadow of the Wyrm) was required due to a naming collision with another fantasy game with the same name.

Localizations take a large amount of time and effort.  The Russian localization was provided by Redfeek.

Finally, SDL support wouldn't be possible without the excellent help and advice provided by people in #roguelike-help on the roguelikes Discord server - HexDecimal, Stof, Smartledore, and others.
