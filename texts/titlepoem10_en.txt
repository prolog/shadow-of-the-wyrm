"...Hear and believe! thy own importance know, %b
Nor bound thy narrow views to things below. %b
Some secret truths from learned pride conceal'd, %b
To maids alone and children are reveal'd: %b
What tho' no credit doubting wits may give? %b
The fair and innocent shall still believe. %b
Know then, unnumber'd spirits round thee fly, %b
The light militia of the lower sky..."
