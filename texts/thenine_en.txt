First, there was Celeste.  Empress of the Heavens, the Creator of All Things,
she created the universe from nothing and sheer force of will.  She made
the stars and galaxies, the planets, and the vast, empty space.  And when this
was done, she created seven other beings, to dwell with her in and above the
cosmos, beyond the trivialities of living things.  Celeste is known to all
people, for all cultures have some theory of creation.  Even if her name
may differ from place to place, the stories are the same - of a divine force
that made all things, that raised the heavens, that gave the basic breath of
life.  The skraelings of the northern islands call her Iksha,
she-beneath-the-waves, believing her to live in the abyssal caverns.
The nomads who walk the upland moors name her as Telos, an old word not of
their own language, which loosely translates as "end" or "goal", perhaps
naming what she has done.  But most other folk know her as Celeste, the name
given to her during the time of the ancient empires, and as much as the divine
can speak, it is said that she approves.

First she made two noble lovers, Aurelion, and The Lady.  Aurelion first: 
from iron and star-fire and steel, a being of impossible strength and honour.
His sword could cleave the earth.  It is said that in ancient time, beyond
all written history, the land was a single, massive continent; that Aurelion,
driven to rage, brought his hammer down from the heavens and shattered the
earth, creating the islands, atolls, and archipelagos.  He is worshipped by
good-hearted folk as a deity of valour, gallantry, and honourable combat.
Ancient people sacrificed fatted calves and sheep the night before battle,
both as a display of wealth, but also of piety.  His image is common on the
pottery of the ancient ages, a great, armoured knight wielding a massive,
curved blade.

She made only seven.  Eight, including her, but the deities are unerringly
referred to as the Nine.  The ninth was not made by her, but is something
else entirely.  A beast that existed before the universe, and that shall
surely last beyond.  Pure blackness, pure evil, a force so terrible that the
others imprisoned it in a place beyond the universe, in another reality
altogether.  Sceadugenga: a word from the Wolf Age, it means shadow-walker,
light-eater.  Though trapped in its unreality, parts of it poke and probe at
the edges, testing its prison, manifesting briefly in the physical realm.  
These appear as masses of tendrils that writhe like a million snakes, and 
attack with such force as to raze entire islands.  Sceadugenga attracts the
most cruel and nihilistic creatures, those who seek the wholesale destruction
of all things.  Its servants can be identified by an ugly black mark on their
foreheads, a rune that pulses and bleeds, marking the servants of the black
god.
