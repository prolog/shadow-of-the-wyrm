The three shrines straddle the edges of the world - north-west, south-west,
and north-east.  Since prehistory these great buildings have towered over
all civilization, proclaiming glory to the heavens and protecting something very sacred.
%p
Their origin is unknown.  They are recorded in pictograms on ancient 
pottery, in old poems, in song.  A detailed drawing was found deep in the
dungeons of Hazharrad, carved deep into the floor, the image itself
protected by a flight of griffons.  Even the Fae, the last link to the
first peoples, so quiet on so many things, say that the shrines were there
before the fair folk were born.

Who built them, then?  This must forever remain a mystery.  But the
buildings themselves have some sort of magic in them.  Vegetation grows
all around them, but does not encroach; the stone itself never dirties,
never crumbles, and the mortar, too; and they seem to shine with a radiance
that can be seen from many miles away.  Each one is an offering, a
symbol from the heavens above that They are there, and They are watching.
And within each one is a celestial gemstone of the most immense power.

The Sky-Shrine, found near the snake-lands, twists and arcs towards the
heavens.  Its stones are white and pink granite, each one flawless, each
one perfectly cut.  The exterior contains a number of poignant scenes:
first of men and women, reaching towards the heavens; next, of lesser
divine creatures, singing praises among the clouds; and finally, of the
heavens themselves, presided over by Celeste, Aurelion, and the Lady.  The
hallways are polished marble, wide, with tall ceilings.  There is the
smell of incense, of frankincense and myrrh.  The doors of this building
are carved from the trunk of a single tree which itself, given the rings,
must be thousands of years old.  And within this shrine, I am told, 
there is the Heart of Heaven, a skull-sized diamond blazing with white-blue
light.

Next, deep within the dwarf lands, is the World-Shrine.  Created to honour
Vedere, Voros, and the Trickster, it is more reserved than the Sky-Shrine,
less audacious.  Its stones are a particular type of limestone beloved by
dwarves.  These stones display the fossils of strange, primordial
creatures, long since extinct.  Hidden in the shrine is said to be the
Heart of the World, a massive, rough-cut emerald the size of a man's fist.
It is hidden with a place that is said to look less like a building and
more like a natural maze.  The floors are thick with roots.  The ceilings,
too, show the protusion of masses of roots, and the walls are thick with
vines.

Finally, there is the nether-shrine.  In the far south-west, beyond the
elven lands, it lies in the mist of a great swamp.  Its foundation is said
to be the ground-up bones of an unfathomable number of creatures.  Atop
the foundation are bricks of thick clay, reinforced with fragments of
skulls and bones.  These jut out of the shrine, giving it a strange and
alien appearance.  Within the shrine itself are all manner of creatures
that praise the dark three: the White Queen, the Black Ogre, and the
Shadow of Names Unsaid.  The temple is said to be marked by a deathly
silence.  The doors themselves are forged from blackened steel of a quality
unknown in the world today.  Who were these first people?  How did they
create such a perfect alloy?  Regardless, these gates are said to inspire
the vast wealth of religious poems that tell of treks to the world beyond.
They depict a great lake, with an island in the centre.  On the island, the
souls of the dead converge to enter a winding, eternal stair that takes
them to the endless depths.  They are surrounded by many things: by their 
lovers and family, by the comitatus, and by the multitude of the
already-dead.  Deep within this avernal temple is the Heart of the World
Beyond.  A perfect sphere of black onyx, it is said to rest on a stand made
from the skull of an ancient reptile, something larger and more terrifying
than the largest dragon-king.

Great buildings attract great interest, and there have been many over the
years who have sought the great gems.  They have all failed, every single
one.  For if the shrines are blessed by the Nine, they are protected by
the most fearsome creatures imaginable.  The heavens teem with dragons 
and archangels.  The earth shakes with the footsteps of titans, ancient
mammoths, and unicorns.  And deep within each shrine lurks creatures the
Fae call shrine hags, impossibly old women with terrifying powers.  Their
touch cuts through the most powerful armour, and is capable of tearing the
greatest knight in two.
%p
Little else is known.  Since prehistory, these fortresses have been left
well alone.  As the fair folk passed, as the dragon and wolf ages came
and went, the shrines remained: stark and imposing and impossibly
beautiful.
