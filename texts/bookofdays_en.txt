Halingsdaeg, the celebration of the ascent of St. Haling, is named for the most important saint of the Celestial Church.  Cast ashore a rocky island, he immediately set to work building a shelter.  The island had many good stones and eventually his shelter consisted of three walls topped by pine boughs.  In one corner lay a bed of dried leaves, and in the center of the dwelling, he fashioned a crude altar from a number of large branches.  The rest of his life was spent in devotion.  He ate berries and wild roots, drank fresh stream water, with the remainder of his waking hours spent giving thanks to Celeste.  After many years of this, Celeste saw in him a truly righteous man, and lifted him into heaven on a flaming white horse, first and highest of her archangels.

Early in the history of man, after the battle between the giants and fair folk sundered the world, a black rift opened deep in the north-east.  From the rift came the black forces of the underworld, led by the foul sorceror Alturin, the Demon King.  Their forces overwhelmed the outlying islands, the tribal communities of men, and encircled the center lands.  It was here that the races made their stand: elf and man, giant and dwarf, goblin and ogre.  Animosities forgotten, they came together as one to fight the legions of the underworld.  The united army was led by the council of three: Urgast, mighties of the ogres; Haildi, the dwarven hero; and Targa, champion of the elves.  On a great plain the two armies met, and it was here that the ingenuity of the races shone through.  Volley after volley by elven and dwarven archers enraged the unholy hordes.  Charging, they came up against a massive, saw-tooth wall of pikes, spears, and halberds, the work of men.  From the rear, goblins and ogres circled to attack the flanks, while behind the walls of men, dwarves and giants rushed forward to meet the demonic challenge.  Alturin was met by the three heroes, slaying Urgast and Targa with his terrifying magics.  But with his last vestiges of strength, Haildi's blessed axe cleaved Alturin in two, and at this moment, the battle turned.  Confused and leaderless, the demons were overwhelmed by the superior tactics of the upper races.  The hordes were annihilated, and through great magics, the rift closed.  Demonstide is celebrated to commemerate this day of victory.  And on this day, it is always mentioned how, when their eldritch magics were needed the most, the fae were nowhere to be found.
