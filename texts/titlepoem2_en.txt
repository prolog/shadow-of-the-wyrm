And then went down to the ship, %b
Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly seas, and %b
We set up mast and sail on that swart ship, %b
Bore sheep aboard her, and our bodies also %b
Heavy with weeping, and winds from sternward %b
Bore us out onward with bellying canvas, %b
Circe's this craft, the trim-coifed goddess. %b
Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller, %b
Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day's end. %b
