Savage Lands v0.1.4 "Andhun"
- Version declared June 6, 2013.  Version finalized June 23, 2013.

- The botanical release!  Added evergreen trees (pine, fir, spruce, cedar),
  and updated the forest generation algorithm so that forests generated 
  further away from the equator have a higher proportion of evergreen 
  trees.

- Added wild orchards as a tile type to the world map, and added a
  guaranteed wild orchard on the starting island.  Random wild orchards
  can be considered for generation when generating forest tiles for the
  world map.  Wild orchards are sparser than regular forests, and contain 
  a proportion of fruit trees (apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear).  
  These have a chance of bearing fruit in the summer months.

- Added a dozen types of weeds.

Savage Lands v0.1.3 "Ealdwulf"
- Version declared April 28, 2013.  Version finalized June 6, 2013.

- Bestiary (a la ADOM's monster memory and DCSS's examine command), and a
  few new minor (flavour) creatures.

- Added support for wands, and added a few types of wands (teleport, frost)
  to the game.

- Changed the item creation routines to randomly set blessed/uncursed/
  cursed status, to include these in the item descriptions (though not
  the usage descriptions), and show an appropriate colour in the UI based
  on the object status.

- Randomization of the unidentified descriptions and usage descriptions
  for scrolls, wands, staves, spellbooks, rings, potions, and amulets 
  after starting a new game.

- Learning of spells via spellbooks for non-Primordial spells.
  Consequences for particularly bad spell learning checks (e.g., a
  pilgrim that badly fails after trying to learn a wizard spell).

Savage Lands v0.1.2, "Aethelwalh"
- Version declared March 28, 2013.  Version finalized April 28, 2013.

- Added support for ranged combat animation.

- Extended the scripting engine to allow for "level scripts" that can be
  executed per-class on creature creation (L1) and after levelling.

- Spellcasting: an initial L1 spell for Witchlings, spells screen, 
  spellcasting mechanics and animation, various bugfixes for magical 
  calculators due to stubs being created in the Early Days, shape
  processing for beams (regular and reflective), cones, balls, and self-
  targetting.  Various spells (Dragon Breath, Wreath of Fire, Lightning
  Bolt, Healing Word) to test the various shapes.  Changes to animation
  to support changing symbols (so that reflecting beams look good).

- Miscellaneous small changes: AP regeneration, some class renaming/general
  cleanup of strings and actions.

Savage Lands v0.1.1, "Cissa"
- Version declared March 10, 2013.  Version finalized March 28, 2013.

- Added different tile colours based on season.

- Updated the display routines to be much quicker - these update a subset
  of the screen, rather than the whole screen, which saves a lot of time.
  
- Added a warning message prior to attacking a friendly creature, and 
  added support so that certain deities Do Not Like This.

- Added Cynwise, the village witch, and her associated quest in Wintersea
  Keep.

- More creatures added and populated within Wintersea Keep.
