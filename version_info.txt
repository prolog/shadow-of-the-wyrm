Shadow of the Wyrm v0.6.2 "de Visee"
- Version declared March 1, 2017.

- New effect type, mapping.  When blessed, the entire map's structure
  is revealed.  When uncursed or cursed, tiles will be learned/forgotten
  at random.

- Fairy spirits will now also remove any negative status or spell
  effects that are in force.

- New dungeon room types.
  
  - Wet: a proportion of its tiles are water and reeds.

  - Dank: as wet, but bushes, weeds, and rocky earth.

  - Cave In: part of the inner portion of the room is collapsed rock.

- The identify and bless effects now re-group inventory items after
  invocation, to avoid ending up with stacks of the same item that have 
  been picked up and identified or blessed at different times (kain).

- Added a "single_user_mode" to bypass username verification of savefiles.
  This is off by default.  If you want to use other people's savefiles
  (passing games around, etc) turn the setting on.  The username who last
  saved the savefile is always maintained, so you can later turn it back
  on if needed.

- The Magic skill now has an impact on how quickly a creature regenerates
  AP.

- New effect type, water breathing.  This allows boatless travel over
  water within submerged tiles.  As long as a creature has this status
  it cannot drown.

- New map type, underwater.  These have submerged tiles in which you'll
  need to have water breathing or will die very quickly.  In normal water
  (non-submerged), survival is based on your swimming skill.  In
  submerged tiles, it's based on your Health.

- Traps can now have effects.  The new monster trap has a new effect
  type, monster summoning, which summons a nunber of nearby monsters,
  whose danger level is between the current danger level and 5 greater.
  This effect is also present on a scroll, which makes read ID-ing
  potentially more dangerous.

- The mad elf, Whitebard, now drops the Ring of Aran Fee.  This is
  a special artifact that permits water breathing, which in turn allows
  the player to talk to the little boy, Ead, in the Barrows, who with
  his strange, magical powers will send the player to Telari, the
  Cloudspire.  These details are hinted at by Cadlind and by Kew.

- Added the ability for races to have the Water Breathing status, similar
  to what already exists for flying and incorporeal.  Set this for
  Elysians.

- Logs now generate tidily in a "logs" subdirectory instead of cluttering
  the main directory. (kain)

- Carrying now gets trained when you walk around carrying a heavy load
  (kain).

- A few items in particular (spellbook of Aim, gain attributes potion)
  have had their rarity set to Common, which will actually make them less
  likely to generate, now, as there are many common items in their class.

- Items can now be picked up automatically by item type (kain).

- Experience points are now included in character dumps (kain).

- Casting spells now has a chance to train both the Magic skill, as well 
  as the individual magic category (kain).

- Traps no longer trigger when a flying creature moves into a trapped
  tile, and the confirmation message is suppressed.

- New effect type, digging, which bores through rock and solid earth.
  Added a wand of digging to the items in Kew's house in Isen Dun.

- Custom maps can now define a load script, which allows for running a
  Lua script after the map has been created.

- Divine creatures now have the ability to fly.

- Disfiguration totals are now based on the danger level of the attack,
  with statistics being reduced more heavily based on the severity of the
  acid.

- Storm-shape spells can now be given a radius.  When less than 1, the
  storm acts as before, applying the damage to random points around the
  caster.  When >= 2, the storm becomes a radiant storm.  Fewer points
  are selected, but these become the starting point for balls with a 
  radius specified by the spell.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New poem fragment for the title screen.

- New non-playable race: Elysian (builder).

- New spells/spellbooks: mapping (Cantrips), crumble (Cantrips), dig
  (Arcane), antimatter (Primordial), malediction (Mystic), divine form
  (Divine), holocaust (Arcane), inferno (Cantrips), shards (Cantrips),
  meteor (Arcane).

- New monster-only spells: wyrmfire (Arcane).

- New items: scroll of mapping, scroll of monster summoning, wand of
  digging, wand of inferno, moloch armour.

- New artifacts: Ring of Aran Fee, naming stone, Telarian Mail, Telarian
  Shield, Telarian Helm.

- New traps: monster trap.

- New creatures: drowned shade, cockatrice, The Sorceror, The Sentry,
  comet jellyfish, The Namer, The Worldsinger, The Speaker, nether hydra,
  sea worm, mesosaur, ghost ray, megalodon, The Conjurer, The Armourer,
  red witch, solarian, lavos, ekakophia, myriadon, lamia, moloch, titanic
  slime, copper bird, bird of paradise, alghari.

- Bug fixes: 

  - The water in Stonewall and Wintersea Keep was marked as river, and
    not sea.

  - When the "prompt_for_character_dump_on_exit" setting was set to
    false, savefiles were not being deleted.

  - Skill training messages were still being triggered when skills were
    at the maximum value (kain).

  - Hrimgar's quest to slay Amaurosis could not be completed if you chose
    not to end your game (kain).

  - Identified items now add the "lore checked" flag as well, so that
    stacking doesn't break when trying to add to an item the creature had
    originally (kain).

  - Moving on to a new tile was inconsistent as to whether a message was
    displayed about items.  Standardized this code so that it should be
    called for all the various types of movement (kain).

  - Inventories in dug tiles were maintaining the inventory type of the
    previous tile, meaning that items could be dropped and lost on open
    ground.

  - Creatures could be generated in mid-air, causing them to immediately
    plummet to their death.
  
  - If the player was killed and then damaged again, it would trigger
    multiple DYWYPI-type messages.
      
Shadow of the Wyrm v0.6.1 "Riquier"
- Version declared February 3, 2017.  Version finalized March 1, 2017.

- Wearables can now apply status ailments when equipped, and undo them 
  when unequipped.

- Satiation effect type.  When in place, a creature's hunger clock
  decrements at ~15% the normal speed.

- Implemented the Lore skill.  This gives a chance to identify the status
  of an item the first time the player picks it up.  The chance is 
  directly proportional to the skill value.

- The Bowyer skill is implemented as well.  When you have a bough, you 
  can use it to create a bow or a crossbow.  Higher skill values will add 
  to-hit or damage bonuses, in the same way that this is done for e.g.
  Smithing.  The Crafting skill also plays a role in the total potential
  improvements points, though to a lesser extent than Bowyer.

- Fletchery has also been implemented.  A branch can now be turned into
  arrows, bolts, javelins, or throwing clubs.  The quantity created is
  based on the per-item weight and the weight of the branch.  The
  ammunition created will get better and better with higher Fletchery and
  Crafting values.

- In-game shops have their items restocked on a monthly basis.  This 
  covers all shops on all persistent maps.  If the player is on a map
  with a shop when the repop occurs, he or she will see a message about
  it.

- Tree tiles now have a chance of generating a bough instead of a branch.

- Blackwater traps are now light blue instead of dark. (Rob Ayres)

- Spellbooks now provide fewer castings when read.

- Adventurers also start with a wand they've found on their travels,
  either lightning bolt or teleport.

- The random villages that are scattered throughout the world now have
  a chance to contain a shop: 40% for a hamlet or scattered settlement,
  75% for a regular settlement, 85% for a walled settlement, 100% for
  a city.

- Quests now show not just the questmaster, but the map that they're
  from.

- Currency is now fixed at uncursed status, always identified, and cannot 
  be blessed or cursed.  This will allow proper ivory stacking in the 
  player's inventory.

- Reworked the item generation algorithm.  The previous algorithm was
  based purely on an item's danger level and rarity, and did not take
  type into account at all.  After the rework, almost all items are now
  "common" for their specified danger level.  The algorithm now first 
  picks an item type (weapon, potion, etc) and then tries to generate an 
  item of that type based on the danger level and selected rarity.  This 
  ensures a more even distribution of item types throughout the game, as 
  previously scrolls, potions, and so on, were notoriously rare, getting
  passed over in the selection process by more common items.  The 
  algorithm is a work in progress and is likely to be reworked or tweaked 
  in future versions.

- Teleport wands will appear earlier.

- Shopkeepers don't like being outside their shop, so they will not allow
  the player to switch places with them. (Rob Ayres)

- Praying can now cause a deity to neuter all breeders on the level,
  preventing them from breeding.  Subsequently generated breeders are not
  affected.

- The chance of a breeder to breed on a given turn has increased from
  10% to 15%.

- There are a few more creatures at the start of Amaurosis' lair.

- The game now keeps track of which creature gave each status ailment.
  Experience is now properly granted when killing a creature with a
  time-delayed effect, such as poison or petrification (Esran).

- Keybindings are now reloaded whenever the game runs, not just when a
  character is first created (Esran).

- Bazaars can now be generated in the wilderness.  They can be generated
  on field, scrub, hill, and desert locations, and will display a message
  when moving on to the tile on the world map.

- Springs in the wilderness can now generate a fairy spirit.  These are
  the spirits of the fairy girls slaughtered by the giants in the sacred
  glade.  If you talk to one of these spirits, you'll have HP/AP restored,
  and hunger satiated.

- Slightly increased the probability of generating a special room in a
  dungeon.

- Springs can now be generated in dungeons as well as forests.  In
  dungeons, a fairy spirit will always be generated at the spring.

- More combinations for random name generation.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New shops: potion shop in Gnordvar, general store in Stoneheim.

- New items: satiative amulet, bough, wand of wrath, wand of arcana.

- New creatures: kingspirit, roiling slime, splitting shrike, marsh 
  wraith, ancient worm, Pelageus, fairy spirit.

- Bug fixes:

  - The Literacy skill's improvement message was the same as Leadership
    (Rob Ayres).

  - Ivory pieces were forming separate stacks when selling, rather than
    being merged into the player's existing amount (Rob Ayres).

  - Petrification wasn't leaving a corpse on the right tile.

  - Creatures could leave both corpses and statues when petrified.

  - Creatures could drop their equipment and generate death drops when
    petrified, but these items would be unreachable due to statues being
    blocking features.  Suppressed item drops/generation on petrification,
    as any items should be considered part of the statue.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.6.0 "Capirola"
- Version declared January 11, 2017.  Version finalized February 3, 2017.

- More potential random names for character creation.

- Witchlings and sages now get fewer castings per level (Esran).

- Thievery is no longer a slow action - it should be about the same as
  attacking. (Dallas Herrin)

- When sacrificing consumables, there are now additional checks for the
  item to be accepted by a deity.  It must have either a large amount of
  nutrition, or have some sort of magical effect.  For food, things such 
  as corpses, silverweed, food rations are all okay; fish and roots and 
  such won't meet the minimum. (Esran)

- Primary statistics (strength, dexterity, agility, health, intelligence,
  willpower, charisma) are now capped at 99.

- Hungerless races like the Fae now can now mark Health when being neither
  hungry nor full, but at a greatly reduced rate compared to other races -
  they only get a 20% chance to mark the stat, compared to 100% for the
  other races.

- When treating skins at a tannery, you can now select the ranged weapon
  slot, which will allow you to create a sling.  These can take on
  evade/soak/resistances based on the corpse like other tanned equipment.

- The mortuary now tracks the maximum difference between a slain 
  creature's danger level and the player's level when that creature was
  killed.

- Character info/dumps now also tracks the number of turns taken.

- Puglists now deal more damage.  They deal 1d(level) from 1 to 25, and
  1d(50 + (level-25) * 3) from 26 to 50. (4chan /rlg)

- When firing a branded ranged weapon with ammunition, the ammunition's
  damage type becomes that of the launcher.

- Oracles get a 5% bonus on experience points when killing a creature
  that has at least one status.

- Creatures now get angry at you if you teleport them.

- Added a new map, Whaling's End, at the south-most part of the world.
  An ancient citadel, it has been repurposed by traders as the last
  outpost at the edge of the map.

  - Hrethel, the hedge wizard of Whaling's End, will trade you one of his
    many spellbooks in exchange for a score of magici shards.

  - There are two shops in Whaling's End: Noah and Itzchak have a variety 
    of goods for sale.  Unpaid goods will list the total price when you 
    look at them.  All shops have a minimum item value, so very low value 
    items (rocks, turnips, etc) won't be generated.

  - Shopkeepers don't enjoy literal door-crashers.  They also don't like
    people kicking the wares, reading the wares, eating the wares,
    quaffing the wares, or generally acting antisocial with regards to
    the wares.  In fact, they're rather unpleasant.

  - Shopkeepers also look out for each other - if they see you outside a
    shop with unpaid goods, from any shop, they will seek revenge.

  - The total amount owing can now be seen with the "$" command.  You can
    pay for unpaid merchandise by chatting to the shopkeeper.

  - When you buy or sell, the Bargaining skill, in conjunction with your
    Charisma, determine if you can get a reduced price on a purchase or
    a better price on a sale, and if so, by how much.

- Added a shop to Isen Dun (food, weapons, ammunition), Forest of Yew
  (wands), and Atua-Elar (books).

- Now that money is more useful, nobles now start with more money.

- More stanzas for the epic poem.

- New creatures: Hrethel, whaler, scrimshander, shopkeeper, seadog,
  swabbie, harlot.

- New items: lunch.

- Bug fixes:

  - Missed comma in one of the naming options was leading to
    three-syllable names like "SulTanak."

  - Keys were stacking incorrectly, causing different crypt keys to be
    grouped together and lose track of the lock they open. (Dallas Herrin)

  - Traps without components (light traps, etc) couldn't be disarmed.

  - Alcien and Rukhala weren't specified as unique (Esran).

  - When deities summoned creatures around the player when angry, these
    could, like regular creatures, be generated friendly. (Dallas Herrin)

  - Branding was not properly adding resistances for armour. (Dallas
    Herrin)

  - Altars could be converted by offering items that generated no piety.

  - Status effects that applied modifiers, such as blindness with evade
    and disfiguration with the primary statistics, weren't having these
    modifiers properly removed when the effect was undone via prayer. 
    (Dallas Herrin)

  - The "fire through" code for archery had a bug in it that was
    preventing the proper targetting of creatures at high Archery skill
    values. (Dallas Herrin)

  - In-game character dumps were trimming left spaces on each line.

  - Doors could open and shut when there was an item present on the tile.

  - Rarity probabilities weren't properly defined for the "very rare"
    rarity, which is used for shops.
        
Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.9 "Galilei"
- Version declared January 1, 2017.  Version finalized January 11, 2017.

- Nobles now start with a number of crossbow bolts, instead of just one.

- Witchthorns are far more dangerous for early game characters.  They have
  a chance to do a ranged attack: 1d3 damage, piercing.

- Added a "brandable" flag.  This allows a weapon or piece of armour to
  take on a particular non-physical (slash, pierce, pound) damage brand:
  holy, shadow, flame, etc.  

- Removed the old hard-coded branded weapons to make way for the
  dynamically-generated ones.

- Almost all weapons and armour are now brandable.  The exceptions tend to
  be specific-damtype items like poison darts and shadow bombs.  Armour
  created via skins is also not brandable.

- A brandable item has a ~15% chance to be branded when enchanted.  This 
  is modified to 0% (when reading a cursed enchanting scroll), or ~30%
  (blessed).  Once an item is branded, its brand is fixed, and it cannot
  be branded again.

- Branding will associate a particular damage type with the item.
  For armour, this will give an additional 15 percentage points of
  resistance.  For weapons, it will switch to that damage type, and
  add an additional die of damage, and +1 to the modifier.

- Weapons have a very small chance, upon enchantment, to gain a damage
  flag such as vorpal, draining, chaotic, etc.

- Now that damage flags are available to weapons outside of artifacts,
  any damage flags will be shown on the second line of the equipment
  screen (in addition to the "W" command).  The "Resists" line is now
  "Resists/Flags".

- Weapons are now less likely to gain resistances when being enchanted.
  The chance has been halved.

- Jellies can now split in half when they're wounded and have more than
  a third of their maximum HP.  The creature that splits off has half of 
  their current HP.

- Up staircases should no longer lead to a zoo.  But they can, like
  down staircases, once a certain amount of placement tries has been
  reached.  This should be very unlikely.

- Bug fixes:

  - Pack generation shouldn't be attempted for uniques (Esran).

  - Fixed a looping issue with entering a map where the entry tile is 
    occupied by an NPC (Esran).

  - All-zoo dungeon levels weren't allowing stair placement.

  - Tile-related messages were not always being displayed correctly when
    moving to a new map.

  - In certain situations on map creation, creatures weren't being
    removed properly which caused the player to be not placed properly.
    (Esran)

  - In some cases, a creature could try to act with a null FOV map, which
    would cause a crash.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.8 "Merlin"
- Version declared December 1, 2016.  Version finalized January 1, 2017.

- Poison spells/wands now can affect any consumables on the ground.  This
  doesn't destroy the item, but makes it poisonous, instead.

- Acid spells/wands can now dissolve any item on the ground.

- Fire spells/wand can burn cloth, paper, and wood.

- Undead now leave poisoned corpses, as do any creatures that deal poison
  damage with their regular attack.

- Mines were generating in such a way that unconnected pieces were
  possible.  The black manticore quest from Gnordvar could then generate
  the manticore within the unconnected piece.  Rewrote MineGenerator to
  generate an empty room, and then scatter rock segments throughout the
  floor.  Connectedness should now be guaranteed as pieces are only placed
  if their enlarged bounding box (which is not minimal - should bound
  with distance 1 to the nearest outside point) can be placed on a set
  of floor tiles. (Dallas Herrin)

- Mines now generate on the world map.  Their symbol is still 'o', but
  has been changed to bold yellow to differentiate them from caverns and
  dungeons.

- Green slimes and red oozes are now mobile.

- Mighty blows now do 80% of the max damage roll (instead of 100%) and
  allow 75% of soak (instead of 50%).  Critical hits still do max damage,
  but allow 50% of soak (instead of 25%).

- Eka and Zaeda's Tower are protected by strong magics and are no longer
  diggable. (Dallas Herrin)

- Additional names and name fragments for randomly chosen names.

- Changes to automove:

  - Automove now breaks when receiving damage, or a change in a status 
    like blindness (Dallas Herrin).  It also breaks when you're attacked,
    and missed.

  - Automove can be interrupted by pressing a key. (Lagi)

- You can now fish using a spear, but only while standing on a land tile,
  and only if the spear is wielded - it can't be held in your off-hand.

- More stanzas for the epic poem.

- New items: wand of acid, Eka key.

- Added a dev script to check for creature spells with bad IDs.

- Isen Dun has a new character (worried mother).  Her son is somewhere
  in the Barrows new, very minor quest out of Isen Dun that will give the
  player a couple of silverweeds, but is more for flavour and lore than
  anything else.

- When the player moves, there is now a chance to search/detect traps
  without having to actively spend a turn doing so.  This is based on the
  Detection skill.

- Dusk and dawn now shade items and creatures as well (Dallas Herrin).
  Also rejigged the colours:

  - Night is now dark blue (surroundings) and bold cyan (creatures/items).

  - Dawn is red/bold red.

  - Dusk is yellow/bold yellow.
  
- New creatures: worried mother, Ead.

- Bug fixes:

  - Dragon breath wands were correct - flame - but the spell itself was
    acidic.

  - Typo fixes in keybindings (Larzid) and game text (Dallas Herrin).

  - Mines and sewers were showing day/night transition because the map 
    type wasn't being properly set during generation.  Refactored some
    per-map code into a common function to ensure this always gets set
    correctly.

  - Various bug fixes surrounding displaying text in larger resolutions.
    (VedVid)

  - Text would sometimes double-line-break, when a line was just up
    against the maximum width.

  - The key to Eka was not actually being placed.  Placed it hidden in the
    rock in Cithriel, protected by divine avengers within the chamber.
    Added a clue to the whereabouts at the end of Gildi's quest for the
    Black Orb. (Dallas Herrin)

  - Fixed a number of instances where custom maps had the wrong map type,
    causing day/night transitions. (Dallas Herrin)

  - The guidebook wasn't referencing the new deity stat modifiers.
    (Dallas Herrin)

  - The game could crash when there were multiple tiles present with
    traps, and the user selected an invalid direction in which to disarm.
    (Dallas Herrin)

  - The monster decision code to figure out what spell to cast would
    crash when given a spell ID that didn't exist. (Dallas Herrin)

  - Zaeda is able to cast Lightning Bolt, but the spell ID was typo'd,
    which would cause the crash described above.

  - Spirits weren't tagged as flying, so weren't moving over water
    properly (Dallas Herrin).

  - Fixed a crash with setting hostility for far-off creatures outside the
    player's LOS (kraphead, Dallas Herrin).

  - Self-attacking creatures were drawing the hate of other creatures,
    which was not intended.

  - Shrines were not being marked as permanent.  If you left/came back,
    the shrine would be re-generated and the shrine gem would be gone,
    since it can only be generated once. (Dallas Herrin)

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.7 "Cutting"
- Version declared November 5, 2016.  Version finalized December 1, 2016.

- Previously, immobile creatures were truly immobile and didn't move.
  Now, many of these creatures have a "sentinel" flag set, which causes
  them to stand still when there are no hostiles creatures within their
  view maps, and to move to attack otherwise.  No more easy rampaging
  through Isen Dun! (AgingMinotaur)

- Poison is now more dangerous: it scales based on the level of the
  creature applying it, meaning that it'll do more than a point of 
  damage per minute as creatures get more and more powerful: the base
  is 1 damage, +1 for every 5 levels, and doubled after that if the victim
  has a particularly low Health score.  This means that higher level 
  creatures that can inflict poisoning are much more dangerous, but it 
  also means that as the player levels higher, his or her poison attacks 
  will become increasingly powerful, too (AgingMinotaur).

- Poison damage is now always doubled for creatures with low (< 7)
  Health.

- Added searching to the command reference in the guidebook, and made
  a few updates to the section on secondary statistics (The_Great_Goblin).

- When attacking friendly creatures, if they have a voice (and not all
  races do), they will cry out, causing nearby friendly creatures to
  also become hostile to the attacker (AgingMinotaur).

- New area north-east of the starting island: the islet of Rowan Head.
  
  - Added a little bit of information to the Isen Dun Chronicle on this
    island and its people.
    
  - Maisy's story is a direct retelling of Robin Robertson's poem, "At 
    Roane Head" (my deepest apologies to the poet).

  - Franck offers to teach the player fishing for a fee, if they don't
    already know it.

  - Fixed some message formatting issues around resting/automove (VedVid).

- Added optional settings to colourize HP and AP on the display for easier
  scanability.  These are "default_hp_colour" and "default_ap_colour", 
  and if not set, will default to the usual white (VedVid).

- As you select sex, race, and class, the information is displayed at the
  top of the next screen.  This provides better feedback when choosing
  to randomize individual elements (AgingMinotaur).

- Made the Guidebook clearer on how attack difficulty, speed, and damage
  work (Dallas Herrin).

- Messages on time of day transitions when on an overworld map.  The map
  itself changes to red at dawn, regular colours during the day, yellow
  at dusk, and blue at night.

- Detection no longer gives messages for when it senses creatures, as
  that's pretty common.  It now checks for out of depth, dangerous hostile
  creatures (AgingMinotaur).

- Hungerless races (Fae) don't have their Health marked when neither
  hungry nor full.

- The search command now actually searches for hidden traps around the
  player.  The Detection skill is checked.

- When the game is starting up, if the terminal size is less than 80x24,
  the game will prompt the player to resize to at least that size and
  hit enter, rather than just exiting.  This fixes a reported issue where
  reinstalling the game was necessary (Avagart).

- Additional poem fragment for the title screen ("Consecration", John
  Masefield).

- Minimum/recommended terminal size is now 80x25, not 80x24.

- Cold spells/wands/etc now have a chance to shatter glass items
  (mainly potions) on the ground.

- Creatures can no longer pick up items once they become overburdened.

- Being burdened now gives a 1.5 multiplier to speed, strained 2.0, and 
  overburdened 3.0.

- Creatures are no longer generated immediately next to staircases.

- Creatures now have a small chance to be generated in packs.

- New pick up all command (";").  Use carefully, as it will take longer
  to pick up more items, and nearby creatures might be able to get in
  multiple attacks (Legend).

- Failing to pick up no longer advances the turn.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New creatures: Maisy, Old Toller, Franck, ancient terror, wood elf
  sentry.

- New artifacts: giant greataxe "Blood and Glory."

- Bug fixes:

  - The damage dealt by poison each minute wasn't being considered
    Poison-type.

  - You could chat during timewalking, despite the fact that everything
    around the caster is supposed to be frozen in time.

  - Timewalking wasn't always being applied properly, causing the caster
    to immediately step back into time.

  - Magici shard in Siriath's lair wasn't loading properly (Dallas 
    Herrin).

  - It's no longer possible to spit out a fruit seed/pit on the world
    map and have that tile's inventory updated.  Tiles on the world map
    now always have null inventories (Dallas Herrin).

  - Twille's quest now terminates properly (Dallas Herrin).

  - The code responsible for incrementing trained statistics wasn't
    handling Health correctly (Dallas Herrin).

  - Miscellaneous typo fixes in the bestiary (The_Great_Goblin).

  - Water-breathing creatures would pursue threats on land, despite not
    being able to breathe air.

  - The skill command (F3) was missing from the keybindings in the help
    menu (The_Great_Goblin).

  - HP regeneration had a bug where the race- and class-based multipliers
    were being applied twice, resulting in incredible regen rates
    with ogre warriors, dwarf pugilists, etc (AgingMinotaur).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.6.1 "Vivaldi"
- Version declared November 1, 2016.  Version finalized November 5, 2016.

- Log filenames now have the format "sotw-YYYYMMDD-i.log".

- Logs older than a week are now deleted on startup (AgingMinotaur).
  The age period can be configured in swyrm.ini.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- Siriath is now a proper spellcaster.  He casts Wreath of Fire and
  Flame Dart (AgingMinotaur).

- Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a few bestiary typos and wording issues (AgingMinotaur).

  - Some tiles in the non-Windows builds had null inventories due to an
    issue with one of the tile member variables not being properly
    initialized in all cases.  This caused items to disappear on drop
    (AgingMinotaur).

  - Backspace wasn't working properly in free-form text prompts in Linux
    builds (AgingMinotaur).

  - Fixed the vault-type crypt crash bug.  This was being caused when
    the item generation code didn't generate anything; the null item
    pointer was being added to the tile's inventory, and when trying
    to render a tile with a null item and no creature on it, the game
    crashed.  This was most evident in crypts, but definitely could
    happen elsewhere, too (AgingMinotaur, barrabus, others).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.6 "Vivaldi"
- Version declared October 1, 2016.  Version finalized November 1, 2016.

- New effect type, Bless.  When the effect type is cursed, an item is only
  turned uncursed, and only if it is currently cursed.  When the effect 
  type is uncursed, the selected inventory item is blessed, and when the 
  effect type is blessed, all items of that type in the inventory are 
  blessed.

- When an item is dropped on an altar, if the dropping creature is pious 
  and the altar is co-aligned, the item/stack are blessed, and piety is 
  decreased.  If the creature and the altar are cross-aligned, the item 
  becomes cursed.

- Character dumps now include all the artifacts that have been generated
  as part of the current game.  This includes maps that have been 
  generated but not yet visited (custom areas).

- Toned down Stormstaff.  The damage on the staff of the artificer has been
  reduced as well - damage is now 12d4 instead of 12d6 to be consistent 
  with other staves.

- The player is now prompted before moving on to a tile with a dangerous
  feature, such as a known trap.

- Created a new skill, Wandcraft.  Wizards and Sages start with this skill,
  as well as Gnomes, though it can be learned by anyone from a quest from 
  Cynwise in Isen Dun.  Wandcraft acts in the same way Combat does for 
  melee combat, or Archery for ranged combat - it enhances the damage done
  by wands, and allows for a chance to use a wand without burning a charge.
  When a creature has skill in Wandcraft, as well as a branch, a shard of
  magici, and an external (beam/cone/storm/ball) spell, a wand can be
  created.

- High willpower scores now modify wand damage by a small amount.

- The player is no longer prompted before moving onto a dangerous tile when
  blind.

- Created a new item, magici shards.  These are used, together with 
  branches and known spells, to create magic wands.

- Tiles that can decompose into items (rock and earth) can now decompose 
  into one of a number of items, probabilistically.  Previously, they 
  would always decompose into a particular item type.  Rock tiles now have
  a very small chance to be broken up into magici shards, but will usually
  be broken up into smaller rocks.

- Placed a guaranteed magici shard in Siriath's lair.

- Created a quest from Cynwise (between her Sun Gem and Wintersea quests)
  to retrieve her a magici shard.  As a reward, she either grants a lot of
  training in Wandcraft, or, if the skill is maxed, she gives a wand of
  dragon breath, two potions of gain attributes, and three scrolls of
  enchanting.

- Additional useful and useless inscriptions.

- Places where rocks can be generated (on field/cairn tiles, etc) can now
  also generate stones.  Stones are smaller and only deal 1d2 damage.  They
  only weigh 3 ounces, however, much less than the 12 that rocks weight.

- Reworked the code that generated ivory pieces for humanoids.  The items
  that can be generated by race and ancestors are now specified in the 
  game configuration.

- Birds now have a chance of dropping quills.

- Constructs, which are animated by use of magici shards, have a chance
  to drop these when destroyed.  Dragons love the deep magical light
  emitted by the shards, and so have a small chance to drop them as well.
  
- Created a low level construct, animated brooms, which can be used as an 
  early-game source of shards.

- Added chat text for Kew and Cadlind to let the player know that
  constructs and dragons can drop magici shards.

- Blank scrolls do not vanish when read.

- Artisans now start with a small amount of Literacy, as well as Cantrips.

- Implemented the Scribing skill.  This currently allows the creation
  of scrolls.  To create a scroll, you will need skill in Scribing, a
  quill, an inkpot, a blank scroll, and knowledge of an internal (self
  targetting) spell.

- In the Lua API functions, get_creature_yx will now search creatures both
  by ID and original ID when given an identifier.

- Added a new, small quest.  There is now a second dying adventurer
  at the base of Zaeda's tower.  Cornel has a locket given to him by
  an adventurer the player is likely to meet early on.  When Cornel
  dies, he leaves this locket to the player.  Returning the locket to
  its rightful owner gains the player a scrimshaw hairpin that protects
  very well against the cold.

- Each completed quest now provides a per-level adjustment to the score
  at the end of the game.

- Additional compound name fragments, with special attention paid so that
  the names "Heman" and "Shera" can be randomly generated.

- After the stanzas in the epic poem on the giant Choros, created a new
  artifact, the seventeen-foot greatsword wielded by Choros against the
  hunting party.  The damage is good, though the weakest of the
  greatswords, but its primary advantage is a hefty boost to Slash
  resistance.

- Added a new unique, Thesilea, to the library in Atua-Elar.  Thesilea
  is a shrinking violet (and chief scribe of the library) who will trade 
  the player blank scrolls in exchange for inkpots.

- Giants are now neutral.  The fact that they were originally good didn't
  play out well with how the epic poem was developing.  Because Gnomes
  could have been good or neutral, and I wanted three races per deity
  group (with Humans getting their choice of any deity), Gnomes have been 
  updated to be good.  The groups are now:

  - Good: Dwarf, Gnome, Wood Elf, Human
  - Neutral: Mountain Elf, Fae, Giant, Human
  - Evil: Goblin, Ogre, Snakeling, Human
  
- Played with the starting stats a little bit so that Gnomes get a little 
  bit more intelligence, and Mountain Elves a little more willpower.

- In preparation for eventually differentiating day and night visually,
  added a new "hours_elapsed" setting that can control at what time
  the game starts.  Set 8 a.m. as the default.

- Additional poem fragments for the title screen (Goblin Market, The
  Stolen Child).

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New spells/spellbooks: vorpal bolt (Arcane), bless (Mystic).

- New items: vorpal bolt wand, scroll of blessing, magici shard, small 
  stone, quill, inkpot, blank scroll, wave locket, scrimshaw hairpin.

- New artifacts: Greatsword of Choros.

- New creatures: animated broom, Cornel, Thesilea.

- Bug fixes:

  - "You see..." messages for items were being shown when walking over a
    tile when blind.  It was still "You see something", but this wasn't
    quite correct - when you're blind, you can't see anything.

  - Traps could be seen via the "L"ook command even when untriggered
    (mibert).

  - Spell modifiers (for spells such as Divine Wind) weren't being
    carried over properly to items such as wands, scrolls, and potions.

  - Settings were reloading with F12, which I'm pretty sure was
    intentional at one point.  However, given that this also resets the
    in-game date, that has been removed, and F12 now reloads Lua state
    and SIDs only.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.5 "Weiss"
- Version declared September 3, 2016.  Version finalized October 1, 2016.

- Stats can now be marked periodically.  Every three hours, the game
  checks for:

  - Being burdened (+1 mark) or strained (+2 marks) - Strength

  - Being neither hungry nor full (+1 mark) - Health

  - Wearing any rings or amulets (+1 mark for each) - Charisma

- Intelligence is marked whenever a creature identifies a new item.

- Increased the chance for a statistic to be incremented when max-marked.

- The phase of moon now has an effect on marking statistics.  The chance
  of marking a statistics when the moon is waxing is twice as easy, 
  while when the moon is full, statistics are always marked - no 
  probability check.

- Added a setting to enforce the character's name being the same as the
  player's username, for the full nethack/DCSS experience.

- Thieves can now steal from other creatures.  

  - A creature can only be stolen from once, if not the player.  This 
    sets a flag, preventing the creature from being stolen from again.  
  
  - Creatures without pockets (insects, birds, etc) can't be pickpocketed.
    Any other creature can be stolen from.
  
  - Certain deities do not appreciate stealing from innocent creatures.  
  
  - When stealing, any item from level 1 to the target creature's level 
    can be generated.

- Ironsword's damage has been toned down, and now only gives poison
  resistance.

- The welcome screen now has an option to show the high scores.

- Barrels now have a specified number of drinks, and so can't dispense
  infinite booze.

- Created support for transmission types when getting a message manager
  instance.  This takes not only creature details, but also a transmission
  type.  The combination of the two drive the type of message manager
  returned.  This should hopefully fix a class of bugs and will probably
  open another.

- Added a new setting, current_month_is_start_month.  This defaults to
  false, but when set to true, the game will start with its calendar set to
  the first day of the current month.

- Implemented a new damage flag, draining, which has a chance to transfer
  a portion of the damage dealt to the attacker.  Added the draining flag 
  to Bloodsinger.

- When no AP is specified for a creature, the AP will default to 50% of
  the creature's HP when generating the creature.

- Implemented a new damage flag, ethereal.  Ethereal acts like draining,
  but on Arcana Points instead of Hit Points.  The attack always does
  damage against HP, but when the ethereal check passes, the attack does
  the same amount against the creature's AP, and transfers a portion back
  to the attacker.
  
- Created a new artifact, Elcrynn, that has the ethereal flag.  This can 
  be gifted by The Lady, The Trickster, and Shiver.

- Mighty blows now do max damage at 75% soak.

- Added draining and ethereal to crones.

- Added more useful and useless inscriptions.

- There is now a text describing some of the lore of the Nine in the 
  rectory in Isen Dun (Cheap Miami Records).

- Support for Linux builds.  Added build instructions/guidance to a new 
  file, README.build.linux

- Some refactoring in the Lua and C++ code.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New creatures: seeper, redback spider.

- New artifacts: ethereal staff "Elcrynn".

- Bug fixes:

  - Improving statistics when not going through the NPC was not
    incrementing the marks properly.

  - The code that handled equipping from a stack of items wasn't properly
    identifying wearable items, or handling auto-cursing.

  - The W/R weapon info commands weren't properly respecting player
    blindness.  Full weapon details are now shown when not blind, or when
    blind and either unarmed or wielding a glowing weapon.

  - Due to a bad refactoring prior to the first release, mighty blows and 
    critical hits did not reduce soak appropriately when applying the 
    damage.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.4 "Barrios"
- Version declared July 2, 2016.  Version finalized September 3, 2016.

- New world map location type, shrine.  Updated the post-world map 
  generation XML/script routines to place the sky/world/nether shrines.

  - Rectangular shrines are pretty plain-jane.  They have statues and
    pillars leading up to the centre, where the shrine's relic is kept.

  - Cross shaped shrines keep the relic off to the sides.

- The blacksmith now gives a quest for the shrine gems.  This is an
  alternative if you wish to clear the shrines, but don't want the
  artifact for the evil ending.  He crafts a divine blade of immense
  power and protection.

- Repurposed Bagra from a random high-level unique to the quest-giver for
  the evil ending.  She now wanders Wyrmeswraec.  Her quest grants an
  unholy dagger, Heart's Needle, that can be given to Amaurosis to
  complete the evil ending and destroy the universe. (Jeremy Long and
  others)

- Boating now improves at a much slower pace.

- Each of the Nine now include the skyborn in their list of creatures that
  can be summoned when they are annoyed.

- More random name combinations.

- Skinning and tanning are now slightly less easy-mode, though still very
  powerful with high skinning/tanning/dungeoneering.

- Tanning now always adds at least 0.01 points of resistance when the
  resistance is present.

- Gnomes now start with Literacy, as do Adventurers.

- Added a new vorpal flag.  This gives a 3% chance to insta-kill
  creatures that are not incorporeal.  Added the flag to a new artifact,
  the vorpal blade.

- Added a flag to allow administrators to set a maximum number of
  savefiles per user.  This is intended to limit resource usage on
  multi-user systems.  The flag is -1 (unlimited characters) by default.

- The size of a stack of ammunition is now based on how on the weight of
  the individual projectiles.

- New effect type, trap detection.  When blessed, detects all traps on the
  level; uncursed, all traps in the FOV.  When cursed, hides all traps in
  the FOV.  As a spell, Detect Traps is mystic and therefore available to
  Oracles.  The detect traps spellbook is a potential starting spellbook 
  for Oracles.

- Added support for marking statistics, and gaining statistics.
  Statistics can now be marked in certain circumstances (e.g., agility
  is marked when dodging).  Every two days, each creature's statistics
  are checked, and if there are any statistics whose marks equal the base
  value of the statistic, there is a chance (~70%) that the stat will
  increase.  Statistics are currently marked in the following cases:

  - Strength: when digging on a tile or through another tile, when a
    heavy melee attack hits.

  - Dexterity: when dismantling a trap into useful components, when a
    light melee attack hits, when a ranged attack hits.

  - Agility: potentially when an attack is avoided.

  - Health: when a particular status wears off or is cancelled, 
    potentially when HP regenerates.

  - Intelligence: successfully reading a spellbook, reading a scroll,
    when a magical attack hits.

  - Willpower: potentially when AP regenerates, when casting a spell
    causes the spell's bonus to increase, drinking a potion, evoking a
    wand.

  - Charisma: when quests are requested and completed, when a sacrifice
    is offered and accepted, when praying while in good standing.

- Sacrificing on an altar now breaks the agnostic conduct.

- Reduced the weight required for a weapon to be "heavy" from 30 lbs. to
  20.  Adjusted a number of weapons to be heavy: Apocalypse, Torasin,
  Urgol, Beow.

- There is now an NPC in the Forest of Yew, Melura, who provides training
  (marking) for statistics in exchange for ivory.

- More stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New creatures: gorgon, skyborn, shrine hag, vorpal bug, gloaming,
  Melura.

- New spells/spellbooks: Detect Traps (mystic).

- New items: scroll of trap detection.

- New artifacts: Heart of Heaven, Heart of the World, Heart of the World
  Beyond, holy sword "Heart's Fury", unholy dagger "Heart's Needle",
  vorpal blade.

- Bug fixes:

  - Slaying information wasn't being displayed correctly when a weapon
    slays '*' (everything).

  - Text paging wasn't working correctly when the current "page" was
    very long, as the additional padding wasn't being added.

  - Very small resistances (ie, around 0) were showing their value in
    scientific notation.  Fixed this so that resistances are still 
    precisely calculated using doubles, but displayed using precision 2.

  - Staircase generation in caverns was incredibly broken (4chan /rlg).
    Down staircases in sewers were also broken.

  - There was an unterminated parenthesis in damage output when the
    damage didn't have any slays.

  - Nagas didn't have speech text.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.3 "Calvi"
- Version declared June 4, 2016.  Version finalized July 2, 2016.

- Behemoth hide armour is a bit more powerful, soak-wise.

- Defined grave-rooms for dungeons.  These contain a sarcophagus that
  is guaranteed to contain an item, and is very likely to contain someone
  not pleased with being woken.

- Sarcophagi can now be plundered with the usual 'a' (apply feature)
  command.

- Updated the dungeon generation algorithm to keep better bookkeeping on
  special rooms.  Previously, some rooms might not be placed, but would
  be tracked as such, preventing the generation of the room on that
  dungeon level.

- Fields, forests, scrublands, and hills now have a small chance of having
  a grave or barrow generated as part of the map.  If this happens, then
  the map is made permanent.

- The gnomish barkeeper in Gnordvar will now sell you food and a drink
  for a few ivories.

- The code has been internally restructured so that weapons no longer
  have slays.  This is now at the damage level, so that it can be applied
  both to a weapon and to unarmed damage (or, later, magic).

- Slays are now shown when using the W/R weapon info command.

- Pugilists are now more powerful: at levels 20 and 40, they receive a
  random slay on their unarmed damage.

- Attack details (the output of the "W"/"R" commands) are now shown in
  the character synopsis.

- Fixed some ugliness with how equipment is displayed in the character
  synopsis.

- Dual wielding is now even more difficult, as before this difficulty
  could be offset pretty easily by pumping a weapon skill.

- Skills now also affect damage: creatures get +1 damage for every 10
  skill in the relevant melee or ranged weapon skill (clubs, spears, etc).
  Furthermore, an additional +1 damage is granted for every 20 points of
  Combat or Archery, depending on the type of the physical attack.

- Prettified damage flags in the weapon output.

- The following races now have some resists/vulns, which should make
  skinning creatures of that race worthwhile: construct, demon, divine,
  insect, jelly, monster.

- The chance of a corpse carrying over a racial resistance is no longer
  100% - the base chance is 40, and modified by the skinning creature's
  Skinning skill (based on an observation by Alzrius).

- Each corpse now produces only one skin.

- The resistances transferred from a skin to a piece of armour are now
  much lower - they used to be the same value, but now start at 1/4.
  At maximum Tanning skill, the divisor is 1/2, and there is the chance
  to increase the resistance a bit beyond the base value, depending on
  the Tanning skill.

- The base rate for corpse-dropping has been reduced from 15% to 7%.

- The Medicine skill now helps reduce the number of minutes required for
  a tick of HP regeneration.

- The Dungeoneering skill now affects the drop rate on slain creatures.

- Inscriptions are now shown when moving to a tile containing one.

- There are now useful and useless inscriptions that can be added to the
  floor during dungeon generation.

- The Herbalism skill now allows finding herbs that can heal HP 
  (blackroot) and AP (verbena), remove poison (white basil), restore the
  voice (voxflower), or reverse the effects of petrification 
  (stoneflower), when generating an overworld map like a field or forest.
  The availability of the herbs depends on the season.

- Foods can also have effects now, instead of just potions.

- The skills screen now remembers the page properly, so that after
  selecting a skill, the page is not reset to 1.

- Added a new room type, trap room, to the dungeon.  When placing traps,
  one to four traps can now be added.  Occasionally, the room will be
  completely filled with traps, and this will generate a warning message
  when entering the dungeon.

- The Disarm Traps skill is now useful.  It can be used to disarm an
  existing trap, with a chance to deconstruct the trap into a stack of
  useful projectiles, based on the type of the trap:

  - Poison dart (poison dart trap)

  - Fire bomb (fireball trap)

  - Arrow (arrow trap)

  - Bolt (crossbow trap)

  - Rock (rock trap)

- Clay pots are more brittle.

- When using destructible items as melee weapons, the destruction
  percentage is now properly considered in melee - you can't wield
  clay pots or fire bombs with impunity.

- Ranged combat is no longer possible when trying to fire cursed
  ammunition.

- There is now a small chance that digging on a field or under a bush
  will yield an edible root.

- Two new title poems (selection from Ben Jonson's "Gypsy Songs", and a
  haiku by Kobayashi Issa).
    
- Additional stanzas for "Tel and Floridel".

- New creatures: abyssal beast, aster, golgothan, fantastic beast, ghast,
  ichor, celestial, muck, mire, manticore, rock grinder, Whitebard,
  magmos.

- New items: abyssal hide armour, intact skeleton, white basil, blackroot,
  verbena, stoneflower, voxflower, poison dart.

- New artifacts: Sword of the Fairy-King, fickle dagger "Fatebender".

- Bug fixes:

  - Shadow snakes' speech text wasn't defined properly.

  - Marvelle is supposed to be unique, but didn't have a Max defined
    (4chan rlg).

  - Character synopsis now displays "Resists" by item resistances, to
    be consistent with the other screens.

  - Long lines weren't being handled properly in the synopsis.

  - For creatures with lots of general skills (e.g., Human Rover), the
    skills on the second page were not selectable.

  - Selecting a letter for which there is no skill bound (e.g., 'u')
    no longer gives the message "This skill is not yet implemented."

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.2 "Le Roy"
- Version declared May 1, 2016.  Version finalized June 4, 2016.

- Added support for reading a random file for a resource string.  This
  won't be used in many places, but is currently being used for allowing
  a number of different title poems.

- Deities now grant +2 to a statistic at the start of the game, instead
  of +1.

- The locked room in Kew's house now always contains an unstoning
  potion.

- Goblin trappers can now, as part of their AI, set a trap.  Whether or
  not the trap is seen is dependent on the Detection checks of the
  creatures the trapper can see that the trapper is hostile towards.
  Trappers don't set traps when there are no hostile creatures present.

- When skills are checked for improvement, if the number of marks is less
  than the amount required for a skill increase, the skill still has a
  chance to improve, based on the number of marks accumulated.

- Witchlings get a new wide-beamed spell, Umbra, starting at level 26.

- Created support for beam spells with radii greater than 1.

- Updated the pathfinding code to use a greater cost when considering
  a search node that contains a dangerous feature like a trap.

- The player must now be standing on a trap to apply it - traps can't
  be applied while the player is adjacent.

- Traps now give a message regardless of whether they're triggered by the
  player or another creature, so long as the player can see the triggering
  creature.  Reworked the trigger messages so that they no longer assume
  that the player is the triggering creature.

- Created a new epic poem, to be added to with each release, found in
  the library of Atua-Elar.

- Each race now has an associated number of skill points that they gain
  per level.  Humans and Snakelings are the most adaptive, and gain skill
  the fastest this way (10 points each).  Fae and Giants are the most
  hidebound as a people, and very set in their ways (7 each).  Between the
  two extremes are:
  
  - Dwarves, Ogres, and Wood Elves (8)
  - Goblins, Gnomes, and Mountain Elves (9).

- When creatures gain levels, they now gain a certain number of skill
  points.  Each skill point can be used to gain skill in a previously-
  learned skill, or learn a new skill when trainable from 0 (melee and
  ranged weapons).  The number of skill points is determined by the
  creature's race.  Unused skill points have an effect on the game's
  final score.

- Looking at a tile with multiple items now results in a message about
  this, rather than an ugly list of all the items in the stack.

- Tiles can now have inscriptions, and the player can create inscriptions
  ("N" by default).

- Added more name syllables, so there are more possible random names.

- Graveyards weren't properly hooked up to world generation.  Now there
  are lots of lovely graves to plunder.  These now have inscriptions, so
  you can see whose grave you're trying to plunder.

- New creatures: goblin trapper, corpse fiend, Shale, Marvelle, 
  changeling.

- New traps: crossbow trap, blackwater trap, electric field trap.

- New spells/spellbooks: blast (Cantrips), umbra (Primordial), absolute
  zero (Arcane).

- New items: wand of poison, wand of shadow, epic poem "Tel and Floridel".

- Bug fixes:

  - Randomizable items (potions, etc) placed on custom maps weren't
    being randomized properly.

  - The Magic skill didn't have its resource string properly defined,
    resulting in empty text when that skill was selected from the Skills
    screen (Redfeek).

  - Untriggered traps were being displayed when moving out of view of
    that tile.

  - When using +/- to cycle between creatures using Look, the message
    manager details were not being updated correctly.

  - Tomatoes weren't red.

  - When a trap killed a creature, the redraw was not immediate and the
    projectile might end up being redrawn in the wrong location.

  - Resource strings for NPC paralysis were missing.

  - Poison dart traps now deal piercing damage instead of pound damage.

  - Fixed a bug where renaming with Nama wouldn't redraw the screen
    properly when inputting a name consisting of many lines of text.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.1 "Beauvais"
- Version declared April 3, 2016.  Version finalized May 1, 2016.

- Added a new area, the Caldera, in the dwarf lands.  Guarding the centre
  of the lake are four ageless giants: Weyg, Rhone, Phole, and Carne.
  Weyg and Carne are warriors, while Rhone is an archer and Phole a
  witchling.

- Added a quest to the caravan master, which will fire after the Cithriel
  quest is complete, to slay the four avernal giants in the Caldera.

- In adding the Caldera and the associated mythology, I noticed there were
  now two distinct "underworlds": the underworld of Greek and Roman myth, 
  and the one of Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy games.  Reworked the
  texts so that demons are now from a parallel world known as the black 
  plains, while the underworld is now the place where spirits go after 
  death.

- The player can now view his or her skills (default keybinding is F3).
  This shows all trained and trainable skills.  Trainable skills are those
  that can advance from 0. (AgingMinotaur)

- Skills can be selected from the skill screen as well.  Selecting a skill
  gives a message as to how it's used (for weapon skills, magic, etc),
  actually does something (no skills take advantage of this, yet), or
  throws up a message about how the skill is not yet implemented.

- Appropriately 0-valued skills (weapon skills) are now shown in the
  character dump as well.

- Implemented the crafting skill.  This is a secondary skill for a lot
  of crafting-type skills, and increases the chance of creating something 
  useful.

- Implemented the blind fighting skill.  This helps negate the large
  evade penalties associated with blindness, as well as the to-hit
  penalties.

- As weaving and tanning now consider both a primary skill as well as 
  crafting, the items created can now be more powerful.

- Working at a jeweler's workbench now considers the Jeweler skill instead
  of Smithing.

- The player now needs literacy as a basic prerequisite to read scrolls
  and spellbooks.  The Literacy skill now also affects how quickly a
  readable item is read, and is also now checked when determining if a
  creature is able to learn a spell from a spellbook.

- One more inhabitant of Isen Dun wants the Sun Gem.  Cynwise's first
  quest is now for the Gem, and she gives a number of identify scrolls.
  She also teaches the player about Literacy, if that skill is 0.

- Since there is now additional incentive to do Cynwise's quest for
  Literacy, the Blacksmith's reward, Forger, now does a bit more damage.

- The Escape skill is now also checked when trying to ascend/descend
  while adjacent to hostile creatures.  Previously, this movement could
  always be performed.  Now, there is a base chance to ascend/descend,
  and if that fails, the Escape skill is checked for a second chance.

- Awareness now plays a large part in calculating the target number for
  magical combat, so creatures with very high awareness and/or evade
  will be very difficult to attack with magic.

- Religion now plays a part in your relations with your deity.  After
  praying, a multiplier is now applied to the piety gain (sacrificing)
  and loss (praying).

- Being favoured by the Nine and spoken to in visions and in their dreams,
  Shepherds now start with skill in Religion.

- Most of the general skills are now marked on use, or in certain use
  cases, meaning that their repeated use will improve them over time.

- Rejected sacrifices now no longer disappear, but are left on the altar.

- Rovers and Seafarers now start with fishing rods.  There is also a
  guaranteed fishing rod in the boathouse in Isen Dun.

- Implemented fishing.  To fish successfully, you will need to have a
  fishing rod and be standing by water.  It also helps a great deal if
  you have skill in Fishing.  Fishing on a map makes it permanent, if it
  was not before.  If you catch a fish while on land, the fish will appear
  on your tile; if you're in the water, the game will add the fish to
  your inventory.  If you lack the space in your inventory, you will toss
  the fish back.

- Artifacts are now always generated as either uncursed or blessed
  (Sean McKeague).

- The Hunting skill now improves combat skills against animals, and also
  helps find more corpses.

- Wood Elves and Fae now start with Hunting.

- Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a crash bug in a Lua API test function.

  - The resource string for the Foraging skill's name was incorrect,
    pointing at Escaping instead.

  - To-hit modifiers weren't being properly applied in the magical to-hit
    calculations.

  - Sacrificing a low-value item and receiving 0 piety was incorrectly 
    generating a "you feel pious"-type message.

  - Both currency and ammunition were generating in much larger piles
    than expected, due to calling the RNG "dice" function instead of
    "range".  This led to stacks of three hundred or more cabers weighing
    18000 lbs. (Sean McKeague)

- New creatures: Weyg, Rhone, Phole, Carne, avernal bat, mist wraith, fox
  mage.

- New items: avernal arrow, fishing rod, rainbow trout, river carp,
  nothern pike, sockeye salmon, yellowfin tuna, southern cod.

- New artifacts: the ruby amulet "Eunoia".

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.5.0 "Molinaro"
- Version declared March 7, 2016.  Version finalized April 3, 2016.

- Added a utility to set the username to empty on savefiles, and updated
  the code so that any savefile with an empty username can be opened by
  anyone.

- Save files now persist after loading, and are only removed when quitting
  or dying.  This allows a basic recovery mechanism from crashes.

- Fixed up a number of locations in the Lua API functions where creature
  pointers were being used unchecked.

- Dying stars will change their evade, damage, and speed based on their 
  intensity.

- Defined initial equipment for goblin pelters, archers, ogre hurlers,
  and dwarven warriors (these receive slings and rocks/bows and 
  arrows/cabers/crossbows and bolts, respectively).

- Updated NPC AI to consider ranged combat when threats are in range and
  when an appropriate ranged weapon is wielded.

- Resting no longer cuts off at full HP or AP when the player has at
  least one status.  This allows players to quickly rest off being
  Spellbound, etc.  Resting still can't be done when afflicted by
  particularly dangerous statuses (Stone, Poison) - in this case, the
  player would need to use an item, pray, manually rest using 's', etc.
  (Antonio Sabochini)

- Creatures can now have skills as well.  Added archery-related skills to
  archers, goblin pelters, ogre hurlers, snakeling sharpshoters, and 
  dwarven warriors.

- Amulets now have randomized unidentified descriptions.

- Changed amulet symbol to '#'.

- Added configuration settings to allow the selection of a default race,
  class, deity, and sex.  If these aren't set appropriately, the user
  is prompted to select a value.

- Creatures can now attack with two weapons.  There is a to-hit penalty
  on the secondary weapon, as well as a speed penalty.  These are both
  reduced by the Dual Wield skill (kraphead).

- Rovers now start with skill in Dual Wield as well.

- Thieves now start dual-wielding daggers, with some extra daggers in
  their inventories.  Rovers start with an extra dagger in their
  inventory.

- There is now a simple in-game help, accessible via '?'.  All keybindings
  shown are the default values (AgingMinotaur/Mateusz Lagowski).  The
  help menu also includes an introduction to roguelike games, a history 
  of Shadow of the Wyrm, and a basic strategy guide.

- Creatures can now be defined as breeders.  Breeders have a small chance
  to create another creature of the same type onto a surrounding tile.
  Breeding respects when the creature generation rate is 0 (via the
  Cleansing spell), so even if a creature decides to breed, breeding will
  be suppressed on the level by this spell.

- Added the breeder flag to fork bugs, as well as a piercing attack.

- Added another entrance to the boathouse in Isen Dun.

- Increased the amount of currency per drop, as well as ammunition.

- New conduct type: silent (broken on chatting and spellcasting).

- New creatures: dying star, puca, tentacled spider, fork bug, ogre
  hurler.

- New items: holy amulet, shadow amulet, lightning amulet, flame bolt,
  arcane bolt, barbed spear, winged javelin, caber.

- Bug fixes:

  - Combat/Archery was not affecting the combat to-hit calculations.

  - Off-hand equipment specified in the configuration XML wasn't being
    equipped properly.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.9 "Mavroedes"
- Version declared March 3, 2016.  Version finalized March 7, 2016.

- Slightly better estimation of the distance to the goal for the A*
  search algorithm - it now considers the movement multiplier of the
  current tile, in addition to the Chebyshev distance.

- Added code to create a minidump when a crash is detected.

- Fixed a bug where certain set underworld maps had bad links back to the
  surface.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.8 "Carulli"
- Version declared January 23, 2016.  Version finalized March 3, 2016.

- Out-of-view features no longer disappear - these are remembered
  (Avagart).

- Added support for special days, with messages being displayed when that
  day arrives.

- New special days: Alari, Festival of the Midwinter Moon; Halingsdaeg,
  Celebration of the Ascension of St. Haling; Demonstide, Day of Defeat of
  the Unholy Hordes; Coma, Night of Heavenly Death; Edelmas, Ancient Day 
  of Slaughter; Solstide, Festival of the Summer Sun; Dragonsday, Rout
  of the Old Dragon Lords; Reaving, Celebration of the Harvest; Elfenwael,
  Death of the Fair Folk.

- Adventurers now start with skill in Cantrips (Darcy Faires).

- Creatures now have a chance of finding foragable foods on overworld 
  maps.  The chance of finding these is seasonal: roots can always be 
  had, but are fewer and rarer, while berries are more plentiful, but can 
  only be found in the fall.  Fiddleheads are the curled fronds of ferns, 
  and are only available in the spring.  The chance of a particular 
  random overworld map of having foragables is based on the player's 
  Foraging skill.

- Created a Windows XP-compatible release build configuration (Legend).

- The game now checks to see if it has write access in the main
  directory, failing out if it does not.

- In preparation for eventual Unix builds, added the player's user name
  to the high score entries.

- When resting, each turn now adds a "." to the resting message, to give
  a visual indication of how long the player has rested.

- Added a new island off the coast of the Stonewall ruins.  This is the
  basis for a quest from Twille in Atua-Elar.

- Beefed up Goblincrusher a little bit.

- Additional logger functionality.

- New tile types: sewer complex (shown on the world map), and sewer
  (individual tiles within a sewer complex).

- Sewer complexes have a chance to generate on field tiles.  They are
  generally rare, being generated even less often than keeps.  However,
  pretty much any non-unique can be found in sewers.

- Created an infinite sewer complex north-west of Aeschburh.  Made the
  infinite dungeon even deeper.  Added a new unique, Cadlind, in Isen Dun
  to tell the player about the existence of these places.

- Rovers now start with either a woodsman's axe or a briar axe.

- World generation now sets a maximum depths on dungeons and sewers.
  There is always at least one 50-level structure.

- Tiles can now have engravings.  For dungeon and sewer complexes, added
  engravings, when applicable, of a creature whose danger corresponds to
  the maximum depth of the dungeon.

- Reduced the depth of the dungeon on little island from 50 levels to 25.

- Wearables (weapons and armour, rings, amulets, etc) are now identified
  when equipped.

- Added an "auto curse" flag that sets an item's status to cursed when
  the item is equipped.  Set the following items and artifacts auto-curse:
  withering ring, Crown of Tyranny, smouldering black plate mail "Terror",
  eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse", stumbling ring.

- Next to the Chronicle in the rectory in Isen Dun there is now a book
  describing the world's special days.

- Winning characters are now mentioned in the high scores.

- The message displayed after winning is more descriptive.

- After winning, the player now has the option to keep adventuring.  The
  winner flag is always set regardless of the choice, so that quitting
  later still yields a winner in the high scores (kraphead).

- New items: roots, berries, kelp, History of the Kell Empire, briar axe,
  fortified dwarven wine, elven brandy, goblin moonshine, imperial dagger
  "Amagari", withering ring, stumbling ring, Book of Days.

- New creatures: Twille, Cadlind.

- New artifacts: imperial dagger "Amagari".

- Bug fixes:

  - Blue jays were, uh, bright yellow.

  - Damages were being displayed incorrectly (e.g., 1d8--10) when the
    modifier portion was negative.

  - Negative damages used to be possible.  This is now fixed so that
    the base damage (before resistances, soak, etc) is always at least 1.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.7 "Llobet"
- Version declared January 6, 2016.  Version finalized January 23, 2016.

- Refactored the curses-based display so that the message buffer can be
  used on any screen, instead of just stdscr.

- Added "Alert" functionality, which is basically just using the message
  buffer on the current window (instead of stdscr) along with requiring
  the player to press a key.

- Cursed items now cannot be removed.

- The cursed uncursing effect curses the creature's equipment.

- After prayer, deities may now decide to uncurse the player's equipment.

- Deities can curse a player's equipment when angry.

- When applying additional, user-requested filters on the Inventory
  screen, the title text indicates that additional filters are in place.

- The equipment screen now displays colours for cursed (bold red) and
  blessed (bold white) items.

- Added hands-required to items.  When wielding an item in the wielded/
  off-hand slot, the number of hands free is checked against the number
  of hands required to wield the item.

- White wildflowers have been renamed to cream wildflowers to reduce
  confusion for the early whiteflower quest.

- Merchants now start with Literacy (/rlg).

- The second line on the equipment screen now shows "Resists:" to make it
  clearer that the numbers and the abbreviations are resistance deltas
  (/rlg).

- Added a prompt when targetting friendly creatures via ranged combat
  (Dave Keen).

- HP and AP regeneration has been updated so that instead of always
  getting 1 HP/AP per tick, the amount is calculated based on race- and
  class-based multipliers, rounding up to the nearest HP.  Effectively,
  for almost all race/class combos, the HP rate has at least doubled
  (except for some very weak classes, like wizards, witchlings, etc).
  Some race/class combos, like Ogre Warriors/Puglists/etc, will regain
  HP very quickly.  And some classes (Elven/Gnomish/Fae Wizards, etc)
  will regain AP much faster.  Finally, the base minutes per HP/AP tick 
  is now 15, so in general, HP/AP regeneration should be at least twice
  as fast as in the previous version, and based on the selected race/class
  combination, could be much faster than that.

- When defaulting an NPC's action, use max(1, (creature speed + 1)).

- New creatures: were-light.

- New items: greatsword, greataxe.

- New artifacts: boreal scythe "Whisperwind" (The Trickster, Shiver).

- Bug fixes:

  - Clearing inventory filters wasn't respecting the original filter.

  - The order of potential actions was allowing ticked-off deities to 
    help a creature rather than doing something nasty.

  - Crash when talking to Hild after gathering the required twenty
    whiteflowers (/rlg).

  - Typo in one of the resource string names for the Cleansing spellbook,
    which caused the book's unid'd name to show up as blank in the UI.
    Created a Python script to catch this (/rlg).

  - Incorporeal creatures on blocking features could not be attacked
    (Dave Keen).

  - Redcap speech text was the same as its bestiary description.

  - Reflective beam spells could get into infinite loops (Darcy Faires).

  - Score calculation had some signed/unsigned arithmetic issues
    (Darcy Faires).

  - When selecting an item to pick up, and selecting none, a message is
    incorrectly added about not being able to pick up (Darcy Faires).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.6 "Spinacino"
- Version declared January 2, 2016.  Version finalized January 6, 2016.

- New effect type, uncursing.  The cursed effect does nothing - when the
  effect is uncursed, the creature's equipment is uncursed, and when the
  effect is blessed, all of the creature's possessions are uncursed.

- Lua API functions to allow cursing a creature's equipment and inventory.

- New spells/spellbooks: uncurse (Mystic).

- Bug fixes:

  - Rest command broken (Dave Keen).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.5 "Bacarisse"
- Version declared December 1, 2015.  Version finalized January 2, 2016.

- Wearables can now include a speed bonus.  This will be used very, very
  rarely, essentially only for artifacts.

- Updated the creature speed calculation to also include speed bonuses on
  worn equipment.

- Random name generation on an empty name on the naming screen (Lagi).

- '=' can be used in the same way as '+' when using the keys to toggle
  target selection (Lagi).

- Various minor refactorings and cleanups.

- New settings: default_name (can be used to set a default name, or leave
  empty or as "*" to do random name generation).

- ESC can now be used to exit tile selection, equipment, magic and 
  inventory screens.  This should include all uses of those screens:
  the readables screen when reading, wands when evoking, and so on (akeley
  and Lagi).

- Created a batch file to run the game plus procdump to try to track down
  a particular crash bug.

- Known spells, number of castings, and spell bonuses can now be specified
  per creature in the configuration XML.

- Refactored the death script code to be table-based and more general,
  like the attack scripts.  Updated Amaurosis' death script, and created a
  currently-empty script for gas clouds.

- Gas clouds "explode" on death, by casting wreath of fire.

- The monochrome colour is now an ini setting.

- New food-related conduct type: corpseless.

- Olive trees may now be generated in the same way as other fruit trees.

- Eight new species of weeds.

- Fruit trees now typically generate more than a single piece of fruit.

- Wands that take a direction (flame, teleport, etc) cam now be used
  by the player against his or her own character by selecting the null
  direction (by default, '5').  Ranged spells are reduced to range 1 when
  made self-targetting.

- Kew now dispenses useful advice on a variety of topics after you 
  complete his quests.

- Each damage type now has an additional damage message that can be
  selected.  The use of multiple messages for damage is controlled by an
  ini setting.

- There are a few new real-world dates tracked by the game: summer and
  winter solstice, spring and fall equinox.

- The map is now updated (either partially or fully) after each creature's
  action.  With NPC spellcasting, having the screen update after the
  player's action only was causing issues with bits of the screen not
  being redrawn correctly after spell animations.

- After dying or quitting, the player is now asked if they want an
  identified character dump.

- Character dumping code now respects existing files.  If it tries to
  dump to a named file that exists, the game will retry, adding a time
  stamp.  If that also fails (typically because the user tries to dump
  several times a second), an error message is displayed.

- Added decision (AI) code for NPCs regarding spellcasting, separating out
  attack, healing, buff, and utility spells.  NPCs have a base chance to
  cast spells every turn, with decisions being made based on their
  health, whether there are threats in range of attack spells, and so on.

- Flame Dart is now range 2 instead of 1, as is Shadow Flame.

- New effect type, Cleansing, which sets a regeneration multiplier on
  the map that affects creature generation.

- Rejigged the structure of the DecisionStrategy node in the game
  configuration to include both the strategy as well as a "suppress magic"
  flag, which is set for gas clouds and which prevents the selection of
  spellcasting actions during decision strategy execution.

- New spellcasters: gas cloud (wreath of fire), apprentice (flame dart),
  acolyte (minor healing), ogre magus (shockwave, minor healing, nether
  bolt), thaumaturge (minor healing, radiant beam), sorceror (flame
  dart, force bolt), lichling (frost bolt), Brimman (ice storm, frost 
  bolt), Gilirien (wreath of fire, lightning bolt), spectral wizard
  (cross of flame, fireball), high wizard (minor healing, lightning bolt,
  maelstrom), deep wizard (chaos aura, nightfire), Bagra (nether bolt,
  nightfire, veil of shadows), black priest (shadow flame, curse of
  shadows, nether bolt), witch king (curse of shadows, nether bolt, chaos
  aura, nightfire), lich (lightning bolt, fireball), lich king (lightning 
  bolt, fireball, fire storm, ice storm, lightning storm, maelstrom),
  Lalo (wreath of fire, lightning bolt), Zaeda (lightning bolt, force
  bolt), Callara (minor healing, dragon breath, lightning bolt), snakeling
  magus (chaos aura, cross of flame).

- New spells/spellbooks: radiant beam (Divine), force bolt (Cantrips),
  ice storm (Arcane), lightning storm (Arcane), maelstrom (Arcane),
  cleansing (Cantrips).

- New items: scroll of cleansing.

- New artifacts: legendary boots "Akos Akari", tiger's eye ring "Asturias".

- New creatures: gas cloud, frostling, Wulf.

- Boost updated to 1.60.0.

- Various minor refactorings.

- Bug fixes:

  - Crash when attacking with a ranged weapon with no launcher (e.g.,
    thrown rocks, no sling equipped) (Lagi).

  - When throwing potions, the last potion in a stack was not being
    removed properly (Lagi).

  - The code for setting a new name in-game via Nama wasn't using the
    same rules as name generation at the start of the game.

  - Generator::set_depth_custom_map_id_properties was copying over too
    many properties.  It was intended only to copy over custom map IDs
    for particular depths (e.g., if level 5 of some dungeon was a set
    level), but it was copying over additional properties, which lead to
    a bug in the infinite dungeon where the up staircase on every level
    lead back to the surface because the key TILE_PROPERTY_PREVIOUS_MAP_ID
    was copied from level to level.

  - Beam spells weren't properly handling going off the edge of an open
    map.

  - Certain weed tile configurations weren't showing a description.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.4 "Domeniconi"
- Version declared November 3, 2015.  Version finalized December 1, 2015.

- Firing through an occupied tile is now possible, when that occupied
  tile is not the terminal tile on a particular path.  The check is
  based on the maximum of the defending creature's Awareness, and the
  attacking creature's Archery.

- Added "seeds" to certain food items (apples, cherries, etc).  When
  a creature eats these foods, he/she "spits out" the seed onto their
  own tile.  This seed is its own item and will eventually be used to
  allow planting of trees.

- Added some guards to a few of the Lua API functions so that they
  wouldn't do anything while the player is on the world map.

- Created a new character, Nama, who like Idem can be found at Wintersea 
  Keep.  Nama records the true name of things, and allows the player to 
  change his or her name.

- Improvised weapons now deal 1d2 damage, plus a modifier based on
  their weight.

- Evade nerf part 1: half the attacking creature's level, rounded down,
  is now used for all physical and magical to-hit calculations (kraphead).

- Evade nerf part 2: there was already a check in place for automatic
  misses; now there is also a check in place for automatic hits, though
  the chance of the latter (2%) is less than the former (5%).

- HP regeneration is now based on not only on the multipliers associated
  with the creature's tile and feature, but also on the creature's
  Health score.  There is a hard minimum of 4 minutes to regen 1 HP
  in-game.

- Similarly, AP regeneration now takes into account the creature's
  willpower score (akeley).

- The naming screen now shows the selected race/class combination, as
  well as the selected deity.  Typically the user will know these, but 
  may not depending if a random generation option was chosen.

- The welcome screen now offers an option to create a new, randomized
  character.  Random selections are also possible from each of the
  sex, race, class, and deity selection screens (akeley).

- Conducts are now worth points (100 per conduct per level), not just
  bragging rights after winning (kraphead).

- Added brief class descriptions to character creation (Mateusz Logowski)

- Dropping a seed in a tile with a hole now plants that seed, and if the
  map is not permanent (e.g., it was a randomly generated field, forest,
  etc) then the map becomes permanent and links up to the world map.  
  The planted tile will transform into a tree of the appropriate type at 
  some point in the spring of the following year.  Planting is currently 
  100% successful when planting on overworld maps (a tree always grows 
  the following year), and 0% on other map types (dungeons, caverns, etc),
  though this may change in future.

- Digging on a water- or air-based tile is now impossible.

- Good and neutral deities now very strongly dislike the consumption of
  undead corpses.

- Idem now only shows you the items in your inventory that are not
  identified.

- Item enchantments were way too powerful.  Instead of using a uniform
  random number from 1 to (danger level/2), the algorithm is now 
  mostly Poisson-based, with a typical mean of (danger level/8).  This
  is likely to be tweaked again in future releases.

- For generated NPCs, set AP to be half the base HP, if not specified.

- Spellbooks have been set to uncommon, so they should be generated much
  less frequently (akeley).

- Item generation was ridiculously biased towards generating common items,
  as those make up the majority of items in the game.  Rewrote the
  item generation algorithm to generate a larger proportion of uncommon
  and rare items.

- When out of depth creatures appear, there is a greater chance for
  uncommon items to appear as well.  Right now this results in a
  preponderance of potions and spellbooks, but will sort itself out over
  time as more items are added to the game.

- Humanoids now have a base chance to be carrying a small amount of
  ivory pieces.

- Kicking a creature now has a chance to send the creature staggering
  back (Mateusz Lagowski).

- Added a setting to always disallow moving on to dangerous tiles.  Set
  it to false by default - players can enable it as desired (kraphead).

- Various code cleanups and minor refactorings.

- New creatures: Nama.

- New artifacts: ruby ring "Falcon's Eye", jasper ring "Carpathos".

- Bug fixes:

  - Idem's description implied that he was mobile, but he was set to
    immobile.

  - Altus' quest incorrectly defaulted to Christof's generic chat text
    when the quest was completed (kraphead).

  - Shields/etc could be used in the ammunition slot for extra Ev/Soak,
    resistances, etc.  Fixed this so that only ammunition adds to
    Ev/Soak/resists when in the ammunition slot (kraphead).

  - Puglists' unarmed damage was being applied even when an improvised
    weapon (e.g., a shield) was wielded (kraphead).

  - The completion function for the Caravan Master's quest referenced an
    older creature ID, preventing the quest from being completed
    (kraphead).

  - A number of monster races (undead, dragon, etc) had their resistances
    and vulnerabilities inverted.

  - Ensured that piercing/incorporeal attack messages don't fire when a
    creature attacks itself (kraphead).

  - The code to remove items (e.g., the Exile taking the Amulet of the
    Two Moons) wasn't properly handling the case when the item was
    equipped in the inventory (kraphead).

  - The game would crash when it encountered a "%" when trying to print
    the game text, because of how the printw-type functions work.  Fixed
    up CursesDisplay to always change "%" to "%%" when doing string
    printing.

  - Fixed a bug with dates in the Isen Dun Chronicle going past the
    actual in-game start date.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.3 "Carcassi"
- Version declared October 6, 2015.  Version finalized November 3, 2015.

- Shepherds now start with Weaving (AgingMinotaur).

- Added a brief guide on how to do simple modding (Zirael).

- Logged an error when unable to insert a map into the MapRegistry
  because the key is already in use.  Useful for debugging while modding.

- Soak is quartered when an incorporeal attack is used.  Typically, this
  will be an unarmed attack by an incorporeal creature, such as a spook,
  etc.  A successful hit generates a message about the incorporeal attack,
  similar to what is done for piercing damage.

- Changed the pierce damage type message from "tears at" to "pierces".

- The switching places prompt now defaults to "yes" when an unrecognized
  input is received (AgingMinotaur).  The "squeeze past" prompt also
  defaults to "yes".

- Created a new "I"tems command to view the inventory directly.  "i"
  continues to take the player to the equipment screen (Akeley).

- Made the Lua code safer (everything should run in protected mode, now)
  so that errors in certain scripts no longer cause the application to
  panic-exit.

- Once a year, the game does a sweep through everything in the game with
  an age (currently just creatures), increments their age, and then checks
  that against their maximum, calculated on creature creation.  If the
  current age exceeds the maximum, the creature has died of old age, and
  is removed from the game.

- Added Lua API functions to add seconds, minutes, hours, days, or years
  to the calendar.

- Weapons and ammunition now show the damage when viewing the equipment
  screen (AgingMinotaur, Kyzrati).

- Added a character details screen in addition to the character dump
  command.  Character details is now bound to '@' by default, with 
  character dump using '#' (AgingMinotaur).

- The game now tracks phase of moon (displayed in-game via the "T"ime
  command).  When waning/new, shadow/acid/poison/arcane damage does
  another 10% (waning)/20% (full).  When waxing/full, heat/cold/holy/
  lightning does an additional 10%/20% damage.

- Automovement improvements:
  
  - Stop on tile features (doors, pews, altars, etc).
  
  - On first move, ignore a lot of the things (features, items, etc) that
    would normally cause automovement to halt.
    
  - Turn bends in corridors automatically.

  - Added a message when trying to auto-move while poisoned/in stoning.

- Wands with a cardinal beam type (e.g., those that use cone effects)
  now display an appropriate message to warn the player that a cardinal
  direction must be selected.

- When wands are used unsuccessfully, a message is now generated.

- Each level now has a chance to generate out of depth creatures.  There
  is no upper bound on the level of the out of depth creatures, but a
  low-percentage check must be passed each time to raise the max danger
  level.

- Out of depth items are now possible as well.  If out of depth creatures
  are generated, the max depth from that will be used.  Otherwise, the
  probability follows the same model as that used for generating out of
  depth creatures.

- Added an "identifier", Idem, a wandering mountain elf.  He can be found
  in Wintersea Keep, and will happily take ivory pieces in exchange for
  doling out bits of his encyclopedic knowledge of items.

- Created a new "Questless" conduct, which is broken when the player is
  given any quest.

- New creatures: boar, blue jay, weeper, Idem.

- New items: wand of dragon breath.

- Bug fixes:

  - Fire weapon was acting strangely due to some code that was shared
    with looking.  The cursor was correctly being set on the nearest
    hostile creature, and that was being recorded as the target, but then
    the map cursor was reset on the player (AgingMinotaur).

  - The currency command was only considering the first stack of currency,
    not all of them.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.2 "Sanz"
- Version declared September 12, 2015.  Version finalized October 6, 2015.

- Added an option ("cursor_mode") to configure the visibility of the 
  cursor under the player when on the map (akeley).

- Made mention that Witchling magic is innate and other magics are
  book-learnt (Calandor).

- Friendly creatures are now identified as such when using the "L"ook
  command (barrabus).

- The game XML now allows defining on a race-by-race basis whether a
  corpse will be left.  Jellies, constructs, and divine creatures do not
  leave corpses.

- Creatures can also be specified as to whether or not they leave a
  corpse.  This is checked after the race flag (the race flag overrides).
  If this flag is not specified, it is assumed the creature leaves a
  corpse.  Skeletons, skeletal kings/dragons/etc now no longer leave
  corpses.

- Made all rings initially unidentified.

- Murdering the ploughman in Isen Dun can now trigger a victory condition
  for the blacksmith's quest (Jeremy Long).

- The player can now rest up (default is 100 turns) by using "5".  Most of
  the usual auto-movement checks apply: hunger, hostile creatures, etc
  (Calandor).  Resting will also halt when HP and AP are both full, if
  there are turns remaining.

- Automovement now stops on Poison and Stone statuses.

- Kicking generates a message about passing through when kicking solid
  tiles and features.  Kicking creatures remains unchanged - an
  incorporeal kick is considered an attack.

- New items: guildmaster's ring, knight's ring.

- Kicking a door has a chance to sprain the player's leg (deal damage,
  potentially add slowness) when the kick is unsuccessful.  When the
  kick is successful, the door is destroyed.

- The default "apply a feature" code (that does nothing) now shows a 
  message for the player (AgingMinotaur).

- Included the material as part of a feature's description when looking
  at it.

- Bug fixes:

  - Skins that had been converted to armour were still available as
    "skins" afterwards (barrabus).

  - Found an instance in NPCDecisionStrategy where a CreaturePtr was
    being used unchecked.  It *should* always be valid, but you know...

  - Various typos (barrabus, others).

  - Dungeon creatures generated on update weren't getting their actions
    initialized properly, and thus weren't acting at all.

  - The map display code wasn't properly considering both map size and
    display size in its output routines (Aleksanderus).

  - Incorporeal creatures were able to drop items on rock/earth tiles.
    Tiles with non-zero solidity (earth, rock at the moment) now have
    null inventories, so dropping items on these makes the items
    disappear (barrabus).

  - Ensured that switching places properly checks for whether the creature
    can switch into the tile - this was triggered by trading spaces with
    friendly spooks while not incorporeal (barrabus).

  - Trap messages were being displayed when the player was in LOS -
    should only have been displayed when the player actually triggered
    the trap (barrabus).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.1 "Torroba" 
- Version declared September 1, 2015.  Version finalized September 12,
  2015.

- Pierce damage is now "X tears at Y" (AgingMinotaur).

- Added a file of suggestions to look at for each release.

- Adjusted a few more creatures to not have 'w' for a symbol: woodsman,
  high wizard, dire wolf, witch king.

- In character creation, name has been moved to the end of the process
  at the request of quite a few people.

- Stopped automovement when stepping on an item.  Prevented the
  item-related message from getting cleared from the message buffer by
  the command processing code.

- Automovement also halts when the number of available directions is
  reduced from the number available from the previous step.

- Tanning will now have a chance to also add a portion of the corpse 
  creature's original soak value to the piece of armour. (AgingMinotaur)

- Ivory pieces are now "free" in terms of their total number - they do
  not count at all against the total number of items a creature can
  carry (Faladrit).

- Enchanting skins can now add potential soak, that get converted to
  actual-soak when turning the skin into a piece of armour.

- Bug fixes:

  - CarryingCapacityCalculator was missing an entry for huge creatures,
    causing bugs related to maximum number of items (pat--).

  - Wreckers looked like flowers.  Changed their symbol to 'h'
    (AgingMinotaur).

  - Typo in a Lua function name meant Siriath's quest couldn't be
    completed (pat--).

  - Items can no longer be kicked into/through walls (AgingMinotaur).

  - Up exit from Wintersea Keep B1 was declared on the wrong tile
    (Faladrit).

  - Equipment merging was occurring for all slots, not just ammunition
    (Faladrit).

  - Documentation PDFs had a stray reference to "Savage Lands" (barrabus).

  - Brass knuckles and spiked gloves had 0 speed.  This was being treated
    by the engine as a free attack.  Changed the speed to 1 for each,
    and updated the engine to ensure that a valid attack is considered
    at least 1 in terms of speed (barrabus).

  - North-east tile selection wasn't being remapped properly (barrabus).

  - There was a bug in the screen paging so that if the number of lines
    was greater than the allowable number for a screen, the screen would
    not page correctly.  This caused the inventory screen to "jump around"
    (AgingMinotaur & others).

  - The option letters weren't being reset properly, so it was not
    possible to view all of a creature's items without filtering
    (AgingMinotaur & others).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.0 "Albeniz"  
- Version declared August 31, 2015.  Version finalized September 1, 2015.

- Small revision this time.  Needed to rename the game to avoid a 
  naming-collision with open-world fantasy exploration game "Savage 
  Lands" (I should have released last year!).

Savage Lands v0.3.9 "Dowland"
- Version declared August 5, 2015.  Version finalized August 31, 2015.
  (First public release)

- Prayer can now summon divine wrath.  When the creature has at least two
  adjacent hostile creatures, the deity may decide to smite them, doing
  (praying creature's level * 5) damage.

- New effect, Timewalk.  This allows the creature to move at 0 cost.  The
  spell is broken when the effect wears off, or when the creature makes
  an action with an action cost.

- Updated the documentation to discuss status ailments.

- New spells: timewalk (Mystic).

- Updated the release build to create the executable in its own directory,
  and copy over the required game files.  Did some minor refactoring of
  the location of some source files.

- Smiths start with either a dwarven mattock (dwarves, gnomes) or a pick
  axe (other races) in their inventory.

- Ingots now have a danger level of 3, so they can be considered for
  normal item generation.

- Using a pick axe or mattock, creatures can now dig through rock and
  earth tiles.  Digging decomposes the rock/earth tile into a different
  tile type (rocky earth, earth) and has a chance of adding a stack of
  rocks/handfuls of dirt.  The item used to dig has a chance of breaking,
  unless it is an artifact.

- Maps can now have properties set in the XML.  Added a property to
  control whether digging is possible on a particular map, and set it on
  Isen Dun and Last Island Lair.

- Added another level to B1 of Wintersea Keep, a storage area that has
  been found by a terrifying, and powerful creature.

- Added a ruined tower to Wintersea Keep.  This area has locked doors,
  but is accessible via flying.  The area is no-dig/no-teleport, and the
  key is found near Ardu in the tombs.  Within each room is a powerful
  artifact of the forgotten empire.

- Made the Wintersea Tombs undiggable.

- Went through the game data and adjusted item danger level values.
  There were a number that were unreasonable for the statistics on the
  item.

- Rovers and Shepherds now start with trail rations instead of food
  rations.  Adventurers start with both.

- Added a "no teleport" flag that can be set at the map level.

- Converted all typedefs to C++11 using statements.  Renamed the "jrcpp"
  branch to "default".

- Created a batch file to create the Windows release zip.

- New creatures: goblin pelter, githra, chaosling, grawl, quaalis.

- New items: pick axe, dwarven mattock, trail ration.

- New artifacts: primeval pick axe "Delver", imperial broadsword
  "Ironsword", imperial staff "Stormstaff".

- Bug fixes: Ardu wasn't generating in the Wintersea tombs.

Savage Lands v0.3.8 "Narvaez"
- Version declared July 11, 2015.  Version finalized August 5, 2015.

- Merchants start off knowing everything about either wands and potions, 
  rings and amulets, or scrolls and spellbooks.

- Apothecaries start off with knowledge of all potions.

- Refactored the room generation code out of DungeonGenerator and into
  its own set of classes.  Created generators for basic rooms, X-shaped
  rooms.

- The player can now set the day of the year in the settings, so they
  can easily start in any season.  Example dates are provided.

- When wielding a shovel with the dig-hardness property, a message is now
  added when trying to dig (by using the "descend" keybinding) when on a
  non-world map.  Initially, this is just based on tile super type, so
  that a different message is generated based on ground, air, or water.

- Added a conduct to track whether the player ever engaged in
  graverobbing.  This is defined as opening a grave or barrow with e.g.
  a shovel, and specifically doesn't apply to the Sun Gem quests in
  Isen Dun.  This conduct gets broken when digging on a barrow or grave
  tile.

- Added graverobbing as a tracked deity action.  All the good- and
  neutral-aligned deities punish graverobbing.  Thieves, however, are
  immune to this wrath.

- Tiles can now have undead hidden in them, exposed by digging.  The
  danger range is half the digger's level to 5 more than their level.
  Currently, only graves/barrows have undead hidden in them.

- Any tile can now have an item found while digging, though the
  probability is currently 0 for non-barrow/grave tiles.  The items found
  can be any rarity within the danger level range.

- Started work on the "need before I release the source" work.  Removed
  the old, dead Code::Blocks project.  Changed hardcoded project directory
  paths to use Visual Studio's $(ProjectDir) option.  Updated all
  dependencies to use their own environment variables to remove the
  dependency on an absolute path.

- Converted the project from Visual Studio 2013 to 2015.

- Added resistances to a number of pieces of armour.

- Bug fixes:

  - Potions weren't adding messages when hunger was sufficiently changed
    by quaffing.

- New creatures: quillich, quakeling, quadriga, quadari, queen bee.

- New items: shovel, sustenance potion, elemental shield, iron ring.

Savage Lands v0.3.7 "Brouwer"
- Version declared June 6, 2015.  Version finalized July 11, 2015.

- Updated Church tiles to include clerics, laypeople, devotees, followers,
  apostles, pilgrims.

- Updated Cathedrals so that when a down staircase is generated, it
  leads to a crypt.

- Updated Site of Death tiles to include black servants, black monks,
  black priests, astral horrors, star beasts, black devil.  These are all
  for Sceadugenga; for the other deities, added zealots, bloodletters,
  dark priests, believers, acolytes.

- Added generator filters so that certain generators can enforce the
  presence of creatures with certain filters present.  Added a filter to
  overgrown sacrifice sites (Scedugenga's turf), and added that filter to
  a number of creatures.  Those creatures can still be generated
  elsewhere.

- Removed the level-based creature generation restrictions from villages
  and worship sites.

- Added some more debug-level logging to world generation so that more
  added features can be tracked.

- Changed the title poem to an excerpt from "The Faerie Queene".

- Added a new tile feature, Bed, to provide a bit more flavour.  Added
  beds to the starting maps appropriately.

- Added another tile feature, Stone Marker, and added one to Wintersea
  Keep.

- Creatures now have a maximum number of items that they can carry in
  their equipment and inventory.  This is based on dexterity and size,
  and does not include currency.

- Burden levels describe how much weight a creature is carrying: a
  creature can be unburdened, burdened, strained, or overburdened.

  - At burdened and strained, creatures move slower.

  - At overburdened, a creature can no longer move.

  - Every pound the creature is above burdened has a negative impact on
    the ability to hit with spells.

- Added per-tile and per-feature HP and AP regeneration multipliers.
  All tiles (for now) provide the same level of regeneration.  Beds cut
  the time required to regenerate 1 HP/1 AP to 30%/75% of the base.
  Stone Markers are 100%/10%.

- Added two new special rooms to dungeons to allow beds/stone markers to
  appear randomly.

- Special dungeon rooms now trigger messages that are shown to the player
  the first time the map is entered.

- New creatures: cleric, layperson, devotee, follower, apostle, pilgrim,
  zealot, bloodletter, dark priest, believer, large ant, hellbore beetle,
  flare beast.

- Bug fixes:

  - Kew's quest wasn't being set up properly.

  - Custom map IDs for lower dungeon levels weren't being carried over
    correctly.

Savage Lands v0.3.6 "Milan"
- Version declared May 6, 2015.  Version finalized June 6, 2015.

- Added a new questmaster, Wispe, to the ruins of Aeschburh, and gave him
  a quest for the player to kill four uniques.

- Updated the mortuary to track not only creature deaths, but also whether
  a creature is a unique or not, so that uniques' deaths can be tracked.

- Made certain characters (the blacksmith, Hild, etc) uniques.

- Keeps are now part of the world generation process.  These can either
  be ruined or unruined, and are generated on fields or scrubland.

- Keeps are now generated as permanent structures.

- Changed the keep symbol to 'O'.

- Added castle generation to the MapTester configuration, as well as to
  the world map generation.  These can be generated on fields and forests.

- Items can now have scripts.  Added support for an "ammo destruction
  script", to be potentially fired when ammunition is used and then
  destroyed.

  - Added an ammo destruction script for clay pots, which can leave behind
    ivory pieces or healing/ether potions.

- Removed the restriction of having at most one random village per race
  during world generation.

- Added a race flag to allow excluding certain races (Fae) from having
  random villages throughout the world.

- Villages now can have creatures.  These are based on the village's
  race ID and the list of those creatures with the same race defined for
  TILE_TYPE_VILLAGE.  Creatures generated in villages are always generated
  friendly towards the player.

- New creatures: Wispe, guardsman, watch captain, spearman, archer, young
  woman, tradesman, merchant, traveller, wood elf moneychanger, wood elf
  bowyer, wood elf forester, wood elf child, mountain elf spelunker,
  mountain elf stonemason, mountain elf skirmisher, snakeling muckraker,
  snakeling magus, snakeling mercenary, snakeling thug, snakeling
  sharpshooter, dwarven anklebiter, dwarven mother, dwarven metallurgist,
  dwarven stonecarver, gnomish adventurer, giant, giant stonetosser, giant
  earthshaker, giant griffinrider, giant cloudwalker, ogre bonegrinder,
  ogre mage, ogre war captain, ogre annihilator.

- New items: clay pot.

- New artifacts: black sabre "Bloodsinger".

- Bug fixes: 

  - The "current" count for creature generation wasn't being
    updated properly (uniques were being generated multiple times).

  - Log level wasn't being set properly from the the ini settings.

Savage Lands v0.3.5 "Tzortinakis"
- Version declared April 5, 2015.  Version finalized May 6, 2015.

- New "X"perience action that displays current level, experience total,
  and amount required for the next level.

- Cleaned up code I'd written pre-common-C++11 support that had a number
  of custom to_string functions off classes, and changed these to use
  std::to_string.  The exception is Char::to_string, which needs to stay
  when I want to convert 'c' to "c" - std::to_string does integer
  promotion on the char it is provided.

- Implementation of the "steal" script: add a message about the theft
  (or lack of money, if the creature has no money), transfer the
  currency, and teleport away.

- Support for decision scripts.  These are per-creature scripts that are
  run prior to the engine's checks for movement, attack, etc - if the
  script returns true after executing, no further actions are taken.
  Each individual function (for thieves, dragons, etc) returns an array
  of functions, and these are executed in order until done, or one of
  the functions returns true, whichever occurs first.

- Updated NPC AI so that even when hostile, moving towards a particular
  target occurs a certain percentage of the time.  This allows for
  additional actions (e.g. via scripts).

- Updated the pickup action so that several of its functions can be
  called from script, and updated the pickup message functions to handle
  items being picked up by any creature, not just the player.

- Added zlib-1.2.8 as a project dependency so that savefiles can be 
  compressed.

- Updated Boost from 1.55 to 1.58.

- Savefiles can now be optionally compressed after the initial write to
  disk - this is controlled by the "savefile_compression" and
  "compression_level" ini settings.

- The game now redraws the display after each movement when the player
  selects automovement.

- Added a new deity decision strategy, Protection, that can trigger when
  there are hostile creatures in the praying creature's field of view.
  This adds a huge amount of temporary evade/soak to the creature for a
  period of time.

- If there is now an unhandled exception in Game::go(), the game attempts
  to create a savefile before exiting.

- Created a new spell shape, "Storm".  This affects a random number of
  tiles within a particular radius, and can potentially target the same
  tile multiple times (unlike ball/cross/etc which target a particular
  tile at most once).

- New spells, with associated spell books: Fire Storm (Arcane).

- New uniques: Callara, Cahri.

- Bug fixes:

  - Drop action wasn't properly using the action cost value, resulting
    in a free action for the player.

Savage Lands v0.3.4 "Mudarra"
- Version declared March 8, 2015.  Version finalized April 5, 2015.

- Oracles now also start with a spellbook of Aim or Haze, in addition to 
  what they currently receive.

- Aim is now a little more effective, so that Bravery can be half as
  effective (+20 instead of +40 To-Hit) while costing a little more, as
  it's a Cantrip.

- The player's bestiary entry could always be accessed by typing "player"
  into the text box; added another option, so that the player could be
  found when selecting creatures with the cursor and selecting the
  "B"estiary option.

- With the exception of various spells that require their own colours
  (elemental spells, etc), standardized schools of magics with colours:
  Cantrips are white, Mystic is bold green, Divine is bold white,
  Primordial is blue, and Arcane is bold magenta.

- Added a new text format specifier, "new page" (%P).  Created a new
  in game text, "On the Faerie Fragment" that uses this to combine
  some criticism with a translation of the Faerie Fragment poem.

- Added the Eka, the Undersea Prison, the resting place of the fearsome 
  cosmic creature imprisoned by the Faerie people.  This is located
  just north of the caravan.

  - Added Eakauri in a locked room in the centre of the prison, and loaded
    the cosmos stone into his inventory.

  - Created a quest for Thengil for the player to find the Cosmos Stone.  
    When the player brings the Cosmos Stone to Thengil, he forges the 
    World-Sword, the most powerful weapon in the game.

  - Added Vigarion near the entrance of Eka.

  - Added four ancient guardians at the corner of Eakauri's room, water
    elementals to the watery parts, a pair of clockwork monstrosities,
    windwalkers, and skeletal dragons.

- Licenses for dependencies (Boost, Google Test, Lua, Xerces) are now 
  contained in the "licenses" directory.

- The Lua "get_creature" API function now first checks by creature ID.
  If that returns no matches, the function iterates over the creature
  container on the map to check by original creature ID.

- Creatures can now have associated inventories.  Most shouldn't - in most
  cases, drops should be random.  But certain key creatures can have items
  loaded on them that are then guaranteed to drop on death.

- A value of "*" can be used to indicate that a weapon slays everything.
  This should be used sparingly.

- Updated the score calculator to also include spell castings of various
  spells, and the bonuses associated with each.

- Created support for running scripts after a successful attack, and
  centralized the various creature scripts (chat, death, attack) in a 
  common data structure.

- Last Island Lair is now (more) dangerous: instead of just containing
  Amaurosis, it contains a number of other creatures, including: skeletal
  dragons, voidlings, old lords, cosmic infernos, lich kings, steel
  slimes, barrow wyrms, shadow wyrms, screamers, Taro wraiths.

- Added the artifact knife "Akkar" to the evil deities' potential
  crowning gifts.

- New items: eka key, cosmos stone.

- New artifacts: the World-Sword, assassin's knife "Akkar".

- New creatures: Eakauri, Vigarion, ancient guardian, clockwork
  monstrosity, windwalker, old lord, cosmic inferno, barrow wyrm,
  screamer, Taro wraith.

- New spells (with associated spellbooks): haze (Mystic), bravery
  (Cantrips).

- New API functions: add_message_direct (doesn't use a resource string -
  should only be used for debugging scripts!)

- Bug fixes:

  - HostilityManager::set_hostility_to_creature wasn't safe to call with
    a null CreaturePtr.

  - Saved games with traps in dungeons weren't loading properly, as when
    I'd made traps into proper Features, I'd neglected to add them to
    the map in FeatureFactory.

Savage Lands v0.3.3 "Dyens" (switching version names to guitar composers)
- Version declared February 8, 2015.  Version finalized March 8, 2015.

- Creatures can now switch places with other non-hostile (mobile)
  creatures, instead of having to attack.

- Creatures can now also "squeeze past" friendly creatures that are
  immobile.  This is a pretty heavy action, in terms of cost, because
  the creature is essentially making two moves in a turn: one into the
  tile with the creature, and one into the free tile.  So, it makes sense
  that this action should cost twice as much as a "regular" one.

- Reduced the danger level on flame/frost wands to 4.

- When a creature dies, it can now potentially drop an item.  This is
  relatively rare (5% chance).

- Added Resistances to the Modifier class, and added XML support, so that
  resistance modifiers could be specified as spell properties and spells
  could add resistances/vulnerabilities.

- The Mystic spell "Curse" now sets a number of vulnerabilities.

- Spellbooks are now common and should be easier to find.

- Witchlings get a new "Curse of Shadows" spell that adds vulnerability
  to shadow.  Sages do not get this spell.

- Wizards now start with a spellbook of wreath of flame or flame dart.

- Sages now start with a spellbook of wreath of flame, flame dart, blind,
  or healing word, in addition to always getting shadow flame.

- New "P"iety command so that the player can easily get an indication of
  their current piety.

- Added a new "Earth" tile type, that represents packed earth.  Right now
  this has the exact same properties as Rock tiles, but eventually (once
  I implement digging) will be easier to dig.  Update the dug-out 
  basement at Wintersea to use Earth.

- Resource strings can now be specified in external files.  This is
  handled by placing the filename in square brackets, e.g.,
  [text/some_file_en.txt].

  - Converted the histories of Yew, Stoneheim, Gnordvar, and Atua-Elar
    to external files, as well as "On Eternalism".

- Bug fixes: 

  - When traps were firing, there weren't any checks to see if the trap 
    and the creature that triggered it were in the player's LOS.  This
    led to problems like trap animations being shown even if the trap
    was behind a closed door.

  - Movement accumulation updaters/checkers weren't always firing after
    movement, so creatures could do things like move into the open air
    tiles in the Tower while not flying, and still be able to move back
    safely, instead of falling to their death.

  - When parsing file-based resource strings, spaces are now added to
    the end of all text format specifiers to ensure that the tokenizer
    picks them up properly.

- New items: lightning wand, fireball wand.

- New spells and associated spellbooks: benediction (Divine), fireball
  (Arcane), heavenly hand (Divine), elemental mastery (Arcane), antimagic
  shield (Cantrips), curse of shadows (Primordial), cloak of shadows
  (Primordial), frost bolt (Arcane), aim (Mystic).

Savage Lands v0.3.2 "Hussa"
- Version declared January 10, 2015.  Version finalized February 8, 2015.

- Added a new effect type, "modify statistics", that can be used for
  buff and debuff type spells.

- Updated creatures to maintain a map of statistic modifiers.  These
  are keyed by the expiry time.

- Added a calculator for statistic modifiers, to calculate the length
  of the effect (the mean is twenty minutes).  Added code to
  ModifyStatisticEffect to update the modifiers to reflect that the
  lowest a stat can be is 1, and the highest 99.

- Refactored the status effects to use Modifiers instead of special
  code to handle things like statistic modification.

- Added spell-specific wear off messages (for the player, who experiences
  them directly) and a generic wear-off message that the player sees when
  a monster in the player's FOV has an effect wear off.

- Spells with net negative modifiers now trigger hostility towards
  the caster.

- Moved Cantrips out of the General skills section and into the magical.
  Added some new cantrips with associated spellbooks.

- Effects can now read in properties so that values can be varied.
  Updated the healing effect so that the min/max can be read in from
  properties, so that weaker/stronger healing effects can be specified.
  Updated Minor Healing to be weaker.

- std::random_shuffle is going away in C++14.  Rewrote instances to use
  std::shuffle instead.

- Replaced the boost-heavy sections of RNG with standard C++11
  functionality (std::mt19937 and std::uniform_int_distrbution).

- New spells, with associated spellbooks: divine wind (Divine), divine 
  shield (Divine), curse (Mystic), minor healing (Cantrips), flame dart
  (Cantrips), steel wind (Cantrips), blink (Cantrips), spirit bolt
  (Cantrips), cure (divine), purify (Cantrips), soften (Divine).

- New traps: poison dart.

Savage Lands v0.3.1 "Frithuwald"
- Version declared December 7, 2014.  Version finalized January 10, 2015.

- Updated the engine so that maps could get creature updates periodically.
  Custom maps (in XML files, etc) don't allow creature updates.

- Increased the minimum number of creatures that can be generated on a
  particular map to half the maximum (previously 1, which was too few).

- Started adding some dangerous uniques every 4 levels (with stats at 
  least 3 levels higher than their danger level): Grubb, Pallas, Kith,
  Bel, Brimman, Gilirien, Hord, Filch, Myrdin, Alteus, Layal, Bagra,
  Alcien, Rukhala.

- Excluded uniques from temporary maps.  This prevents the player from
  being able to leave the map and never have to face the unique again.

- Separated traps from features.  Originally a feature could have a trap,
  but I decided to make things simpler, make a trap a subclass of a 
  feature, and just have a trap be a potential feature that could be
  present on a tile.

- Added damage and description SIDs to the Trap class, as well as a
  trigger message SID, and a player damage message SID.  Traps display
  a damage message only when the player steps on the trap.  Added colours
  so that traps can be differentiated on the map at a glance (fireball
  is red, spiked floor is white, etc).

- Traps also have simple animations when triggered, in addition to
  messages.

- Added a "uses" counter to features.  This is -1 for most features
  (unlimited uses) and will be set to > 0 for traps.  When the counter
  reaches 0, the feature is removed from the tile (the trap is spent,
  basically).

- Added traps to dungeons, caverns, and mines.  Traps are applied on 
  movement  when the creature fails a Detection check.  Some traps (arrow 
  and rock, for now) have a chance to generate items when triggered.

- Kick messages for barrels and traps.

- Critical hits are now more powerful, allowing only a quarter of the
  creature's Soak score, rather than the half that was previously used.

- Logging is now set in the ini settings, as is the display.

- Added a section to the Guidebook entitled "The World", which talks
  about the Savage Lands world, travelling, combat, quests, etc.

- After spending an hour tracking down a serialization bug related to
  the write_enum template function, converted all instances of enums
  (old C++-style unscoped enums) to C++11-style scoped enums, and replaced
  the template function with a proper, statically-typed function.
  This...took a while.

- Bug fixes: 
  
  - Too many room features were being generated in dungeons.
  
  - Hide items with dynamic descriptions (which weren't supposed to be 
  generated randomly) were being generated randomly, and the "%s" was
  causing curses outputting issues.
  
  - Properly considered a creature's maximum number when creating the 
  creature generation maps.

  - Updated the code to apply pierce-effects at the DamageCalculatorPtr
  level instead of in combat manager, so that when damage is applied
  outside of combat (e.g. traps) and is piercing, the piercing flag is
  properly handled.

- New creatures: Pallas, Grubb, Kith, Bel, Brimman, Gilirien, Hord,
  Filch, Myrdin, Alteus, Layal, Bagra, Alcien, Rukhala.

- New traps: fireball, arrow, rock, floor spikes, flash.

Savage Lands v0.3.0 "Theodric"
- Version declared November 11, 2014.  Version finalized December 7, 2014.

- Created tanneries.  These are tile features that can be used to treat
  skins to make leather armour/boots.

  - When at a tannery, and the creature applies the tannery, they are
    prompted to select a skin, and then an equipment slot.  An item of
    the appropriate type is then created.

  - The item has a chance of having additional evade and soak based on
    the creature's Tanning skill.

- Created jeweler's workbenches.  These tile features are used to
  improve rings and amulets with gold.  Rings and amulets follow the same
  rules as armour for improvement by goldsmithing.

- Added the ability to skin a corpse (mapped by default to "/").  Skinning
  has the chance to produce a skin, which can be used at a tannery to
  create new armour.

- The tavern in Gnordvar didn't seem to have any barrels of alcohol -
  added some whisky and gnomish stout.

- Added a tile feature, Wheel and Loom, that allows the conversion of
  natural fibres into clothing.

- Added a tannery and a wheel and loom to Isen Dun and a jeweler's 
  workbench to Gnordvar.  Added Hild to the house with the
  wheel and loom.  Added a tanner to the tannery.

- Created a quest for Hild: she needs a good supply of whiteflower,
  but needs the player to retrieve it for her, as her workload and the
  danger of the outside world have made retreiving all the fibre she
  requires a difficult proposition.

  - Completion of the quest increases the player's Weaving score by up
    to 20.  If the player has greater than 80 in Weaving, Hild will
    also present the Wintersea Mantle.

- Skinning now influences:

  - the chance of a successful skin attempt

  - whether a "bonus" skin is created on a successful attempt

- Weaving now influences:

  - the ability to use a wheel and loom

  - the ability to create an excellent piece of clothing, with additional
    (free) enchants based on the Weaving score

- Foraging now increases the chance that a creature will drop a corpse.

- Minstrels now start with a musical instrument.

- Field tiles now have a small chance to generate a wildflower or
  whiteflower in summer.

- For a bit more descriptive flavour, added several distinctive corpses
  to the approach to Amaurosis' lair.

- Misc: renamed "About Body" to "Around Body" at the suggestion of people
  on /r/roguelikedev.

- Bug fixes: fixed an issue with item generation in treasure rooms.  Fixed
  an item stacking issue where additional properties should have been
  considered, but weren't.

- New items: protective amulet, evasive amulet, hide armour, hide cloak,
  hide cap, hide boots, lute, fife, dulcimer, sackbut, fiddle, horn,
  whiteflower, three particular un-generatable corpses.

- New artifacts: Mantle of Wintersea.

- New creatures: Hild, tanner.

Savage Lands v0.2.9 "Aethelric"
- Version declared October 15, 2014.  Version finalized November 11, 2014.

- Sacrificing on a co-aligned altar adjusts the creature's alignment
  very slightly: good increases alignment, evil decreases it, and neutral
  will increase or decrease based on the creature's alignment relative to
  0.

- Sacrificing on a cross-aligned altar has a chance to convert the altar,
  based on the value of the item(s) sacrificed.  The creature's alignment
  will be adjusted based on whether the altar was converted or not.
  
- Changing alignment to a different range (good -> neutral, etc) has
  the following effects:

  - If the creature was a champion, it becomes a fallen champion of all
    deities.

  - A random deity of the new alignment is selected, and the creature
    then worships that deity.

- Angering the Nine is now a lot more deadly: it can result in getting
  one's equipment and inventory destroyed, being lowered to 1 HP/AP,
  or having a number of high-level and generally deadly creatures
  summoned immediately adjacent.

- There is now a small chance for an altar to be generated on a given
  dungeon level.

- Dungeons can now also contain zoos, which are rooms filled with
  creatures suitable for the given map and danger level.  There can be
  at most one zoo per level.

- As well, dungeons can contain a treasure room, a room with a handful of 
  out of depth creatures and an item, sort of a less dangerous version of 
  a vault.

- Characters get a bonus to all statistics when created on Creator's
  Day (September 1).

- Items that are found in more dangerous places are more powerful,
  receiving a random number of base enchantments (not counting against
  the total for the item) up to half the current danger level with 
  uniform probability.

- Added a new effect, gain attributes, and created a Potion of Gain
  Attributes.
  
  - Cursed: do nothing.

  - Uncursed: +1 to two statistics.

  - Blessed: +1 to all statistics.

- Smithing is now possible, as long as the following conditions are
  met: Smithing skill > 0, wielding a club/hammer, ingots in inventory.

  - Ingots can only affect items made of the same material as the ingots.

  - Artifacts can't be improved, either by smithing or enchanting.

  - There is a chance that smithing will improve a physical resistance
    (either Slash, Pierce, or Pound).  A weapon will always improve
    some combination of to-hit and damage, in addition to the possibility
    of improved resistances; and likewise for armour with evade and soak.

- Smiths now start with an iron ingot, and if they complete the
  Blacksmith's quest, in addition to the usual reward, he also grants
  a couple of iron ingots and a steel ingot.

- Added a new material, gold.  All rings and amulets are now made of gold
  instead of their previous materials.

- New artifacts: rune-covered rod "Light of Battle" (neutral), giant-
  forged sword "Beow" (lawful), black hand crossbow "Shadow" (evil),
  silent sling "Pelter" (all).

- New creatures: oread.

- New items: gain attributes potion, iron ingot, steel ingot.

- New features: forge.

- Bug fixes: when descending down in dungeons, the wrong map type was
  generated.

Savage Lands v0.2.8 "Adda"
- Version declared September 13, 2014.  Version finalized October 15, 2014.

- Created deity-specific crowning gifts to provide some additional
  differentiation (once crowning is implemented) beyond the deity's bonus
  to statistics at character creation.

  - Celeste: celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade"

  - Aurelion: battle-armour of Aurelion

  - The Lady: divine spear "Radiance"

  - Vedere: alabaster rod "Creator's Might"

  - Voros: titantic battle axe "Earthcleaver"

  - The Trickster: Shroud of Fate

  - Shiver: frost-covered athame "Winter"

  - Urgoth: colossal stone club "Urgol"

  - Sceadugenga: eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"

- Crowning will now happen after praying when the creature is uncrowned, 
  and has a piety greater than the minimum required for crowning.  The 
  deity will give a 10% reduction to all damage (in practical terms, -0.10 
  to all damage types for the creature's intrinsic resistances), and grant 
  a crowning gift.  The crowning gift will be either an artifact, or a 
  pile of money.  The money is only generated if none of the artifacts can 
  be generated (e.g., if they have already been generated in-game).

- Created two more guaranteed altars - a neutral altar in Wintersea Keep,
  and a chaotic altar in the ruins of Stonewall.

- Created a new offer command, used to offer sacrifices to one's deity,
  and mapped it to "O".

  - Piety is increased as creatures make offerings, and a message is
    shown after sacrifice to give the player a general indication of 
    their piety.

- Added the kick command, and mapped it to "K".

  - Features are kickable.  Kicking a feature generates a message about
    kicking either the feature, or "something", depending on whether the
    player is blinded or not.

  - Creatures can be kicked as well.  Kicking is an unarmed attack with
    the same characteristics as a regular unarmed attack.

  - Kicking items moves them one tile over, assuming that's a valid move.
    If it's not a valid move, energy is expended, but the item is not
    moved.

- Each deity now has its own anger message, to add a little bit more
  flavour.

- Refactored the feature-handling code out of the feature and into
  manipulator classes located in the engine.  This provides more
  separation between engine and model, as the features in the world
  subdirectory are intended to mostly be data structures.  Features,
  for example, shouldn't manipulate tiles - that's the engine's job.

- Creatures didn't have alignments, before.  Deities could be selected
  based on race, but there was no concept of alignment at the creature-
  level.  Made Alignment a serializable class and added it to Creature.
  Creatures now get their alignment set based on the deity's range,
  and alignment is included in character dumps.

- New artifacts: celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade", battle-armour of
  Aurelion, divine spear "Radiance", alabaster rod "Creator's Might",
  titantic battle axe "Earthcleaver", Shroud of Fate, frost-covered athame
  "Winter", colossal stone club "Urgol", eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"

- New items: athame.

- New creatures: seagull, dryad.

- Bug fixes: eating food off the ground wasn't removing the item from the
  tile's inventory after eating.  Unarmed attacks weren't adding the
  appropriate bonuses for the unarmed combat skill.  The clean_string
  function would die when the character value for a particular part of
  a string was out of range - added a fix to default the character to '?'.

Savage Lands v0.2.7 "Glappa"
- Version declared August 13, 2014.  Version finalized September 13, 2014.

- More early game quests!  Started working on a quest for Kew that uses
  the south-east dungeon.  Kew gives a quest to slay an agent of
  Sceadugenga, Siriath, early in the dungeon.  Siriath is found on
  the fifth floor.

  - Created a fixed map for the 4th or 5th floor, that will hook up to the
    generated maps.  The floor that the level appears on is selected
    randomly.

- Added the ability to eat items off the ground - the player no longer
  needs to pick up an item just to eat it immediately.

- Created a new effect type, Cross, and created a new arcane spell, 
  Cross of Flame, to demonstrate it.

- Corpses now track the race ID of the killed creature.  Eating the corpse
  causes the game to check for cannibalism, which then notifies the
  creature's deity.  Some deities (particularly the good ones) disapprove
  of cannibalism.

- Defined the crowning gifts for each deity.  For now, the good, neutral,
  and evil deities all, as a group, have the same crowning artifacts:

  - Common: great mace of Torasin, eternal longsword "Erebus"

  - Good: Sunsword, Dragonbane, Beastbinder, Alaric's mail shirt

  - Neutral: Dragonsfist, Bugcrusher, Jellysmasher, Knife of the Long
    Hunt, dragon-leather armour of Tius

  - Evil: Kithslayer, Staff of the Artificer, Skyslayer, Terror, Crown
    of Tyranny, Helm of the Heavens

- Since deities now reference items, and items are serialized, deities are
  now serialized as well.

- New creatures: xither, kalath, mirshi.

- New artifacts: Alaric's mail shirt, smouldering black plate mail
  "Terror", dragon-leather armour of Tius, Crown of Tyranny, Helm of the
  Heavens, great mace of Torasin, eternal longsword "Erebus"

- Bug fixes: 
  
  - Many creatures were missing Cavern in their list of allowable
    terrain types - added Cavern to those lists where appropriate (pretty
    much everywhere).  
    
  - Piety wasn't being updated properly for displeasing actions like
    attacking friendly creatures or cannibalism.

  - The "B"estiary command wasn't available during tile selection after
    the recent conversion to use user-defined mappings.

Savage Lands v0.2.6 "Ida"
- Version declared July 13, 2014.  Version finalized August 13, 2014.

- Started working on monster corpses.

  - Incorporeal monsters will drop corpses.  The weight of the corpse
    varies based on the size of the creature, so the player will
    (eventually, once I add proper weight tracking) not be able to 
    lift up the corpse of a dragon or a behemoth.

  - Corpse colour is always the creature's colour.

  - Creatures with a poison component in their damage type leave a
    poisoned corpse.  Poisoned consumables (whether food or potion) have
    a good chance of poisoning the eater/quaffer.

  - When creatures die, their race/class resistances are transferred
    to the corpse.  Vulnerabilities are not transferred.

  - When a corpse (or other food or drink) with resistances) is consumed,
    the creature's race, class, and intrinsic resistances are checked.  
    If any of the corpses's resistances are greater than the total of
    these, the creature gets the delta added to its intrinsic resists,
    and a message is added if the creature is the player, to indicate the
    type of resistance gained.

- Support for creature titles.  These are based on class (though there is
  also a generic "the Unknown"-type title for those cases where creatures
  don't have classes), and are gained at levels 1, 10, 20, 30, and 45.

- Added support for races to be able to fly automatically.

- Made water tiles safe for flying creatures.

- Created a new race, Bird, and set the Flying flag.

- Added a new text formatter for line breaks (so that text can be broken
  up either by line or by paragraph).  Created a poem for the library of
  Atua-Elar.

- Lua API updates: added the ability to provide an array of replacement
  strings to most of the "add_message"-type functions.  Refactored the
  Lua API functions out of ScriptEngine and into their own header/source.

- New items: philosophical tract "On Eternalism" (added to the Atua-Elar
  library), lituus.

- New creatures: pelican.

Savage Lands v0.2.5 "Eoppa"
- Version declared June 15, 2014.  Version finalized July 13, 2014.

- Added rudimentary support for reading ini settings.  The game will now
  first check for a settings file in the user's home directory.  If the
  file isn't found, it'll next check the game's directory.

  - Set the default language file (savagelandstext_en.ini) in the ini
    settings.

  - Allowed redefining keybindings for commands in the main game (eating,
    quaffing, movement, etc).

  - Allowed redefinition of some of the tile selection keys (movement and
    bestiary) to remain consistent with the redefinition of the higher-
    level commands.

- Added a message buffer to the message manager.  Each message that goes
  to the message manager is also added to the message buffer, up to a
  particular maximum size.

  - Hooked the message manager up to the character dumper, so that the
    latest (15 by default) are included in the dump.

  - Added the "M" command to display in-game message history.

- Started working on the Snake Lands, the area containing the snakeling
  village and Zaeda's Tower:

  - Created the inhabitants of the village of Sithrin.  Populated the
    village - it's less of a village and more of a mini-dungeon.  There
    are a few buildings, each of which has useful items: a spellbook;
    poison and freezing arrows; and the rune stone.

  - Added the island to the far north-east corner, adding a reference in
    the Isen Dun Chronicle.

  - Created the custom map for the base and top floors of Zaeda's Tower.

  - Added Altus to the base of the tower.  His quest will let the player
    know what they need to do to open the door.

- Created a new tile type, Air, and used this for populating the region
  around the top of Zaeda's Tower.

  - The game will prompt the player about stepping out into an open air
    tile, since it is considered dangerous.

  - Unless the creature has the ability to fly, the creature will plummet
    to their immediate death.

  - Populated the top floor of Zaeda's Tower with Zaeda and a number of
    creatures in the 25-30 range.

- Added a Flying status effect, and a corresponding potion.

- Misc: added a "player" creature that should not be generatable
  (basically, just for the bestiary entry).

- New creatures: thaumaturge, snakeling assassin, snakeling conjurer,
  snakeling thief, Kraal, Murk, Altus, Zaeda, abomination, forerunner,
  planewalker, stone worm.

- New items: flying potion, august longbow "Lora", poison arrows, freezing
  arrows.

- New spells: flight (Arcane).
      
- Bug fixes:

  - Fixed an issue where the ActionCoordinator would not be properly reset 
  on the first turn after loading a game, to a loop being exited 
  prematurely, fixed the race on quivering blob (set to jelly; was 
  snakeling).

  - Fixed an issue where world map tiles generated from WorldMapAreas.xml
  could potentially have items on them.

Savage Lands v0.2.4 "Esa"
- Version declared May 4, 2014.  Version finalized June 15, 2014.

- Sped up the crypt generation a little (switched to vector<Coordinate>
  instead of set, pre-reserved sizes, etc).

- Refactored the graveyard generation code so that it would be possible to
  generate graves over a range of values on a given map.

- Began work on Aeschburh, a ruined settlement referenced in the Isen Dun
  Chronicle.  It sits to the north-west of Isen Dun, and at night, strange
  lights can be seen from across the water.

  - Added black servants, Pirrha, and will o' the wisps.  Created support
    for generating random amounts of certain creatures on set maps,
    similar to what is done already with generating lists of creatures on
    maps created from a tile's terrain type.

  - Created a second quest for Cynwise, to slay Pirrha in Aeschburh, the
    reward for which is Cynehild's Shroud.

- Updated pugilists so that they start with brass knuckles in their
  inventory.  Kept it in the inventory and kept them unarmed as a hint
  that, long term, unarmed is the better path.

- Increased the damage on the existing artifact weapons.

- Cleaned up some of the field generation code - this doesn't just generate
  fields, but also special features like dungeons and field-based villages.
  Updated this code to also consider generating crypts, which will generate
  at half the probability (0.25%) of dungeons.  Crypts are ancient, long-
  forgotten features, which is why they're scattered randomly over the
  world instead of tied to settlements like some other features.

- The custom maps now have level range information.  This isn't used
  in-game (yet?), but gets used by an external Python script to help me
  see what level ranges are reasonably well covered, and which need some
  additional areas.

- Began working on the Fae Caravan, an area located on a far northern
  island covered with fruit trees.

  - Added the caravan master, and a number of caravan guards, fae
    musicians, and fae travellers.

  - Created a quest from the caravan master to clear the taint from
    Cithriel, the ancient home of the Fae.

- Began work on Cithriel, accessible only from the Fae Caravan.

  - Added five named black summoners throughout the hall.

  - Surrounded each by a number of creatures in the 26-35 range.

  - Added additional cosmological creatures and demons randomly throughout
    the level.

- Names can now be set in the custom map XML.

- Added new items: brass knuckles, spiked glove, iron claw.

- New creatures: black servant, Pirrha, will o' the wisp, grave worm,
  caravan master, fae musician, fae traveller, caravan guard, black
  summoner, red lady.

- New artifacts: the jewelled claw "Dragon's Fist", Cynehild's Shroud,
  fae-forged sword "Erandu".

- Misc: standardized on "screen" instead of just "menu", updating lots of
  file/class names/resource strings/filters/etc, added a new "common"
  folder in the Lua scripts and added a "creature" module within that.

- New API functions: get_creature_yx (returns two values, a given 
  creature's y and x coordinates in the current map), get_current_map_id
  (returns the ID of the current map), map_transform_tile (converts a tile
  to a new tile type, preserving the various details of the old tile),
  log, map_add_tile_exit (add an exit to a custom map).

- Bug fixes: ensured correct spacing between flags on the inventory
  screen.

Savage Lands v0.2.3 "Eadwine"
- Version declared March 22, 2014.  Version finalized May 4, 2014.

- Started work on the documentation, specifically a Nethack-esque guidebook
  explaining the game and describing the basic commands.

  - Created an initial chapter on the game: a basic "why you're here".

  - Created a chapter with information on races, classes, deities, skills, 
    resistances, and so on.

  - Created a command reference, and also added a separate "quick
    reference" PDF with just command information.

  - Broke out each chapter into its own TeX file.

- Gave sages access to primordial spells, though they gain fewer castings,
  start learning the spells at a higher level, and don't get access to
  Veil of Shadows.

- Refactored the Inventory display.  Instead of being displayed directly
  by an instance of the Display interface, it will now be a regular
  menu (like the Equipment screen).

- Moved the character option (i.e., "a" for option 0, "c" for option 2,
  etc) out of the Display and made it a property of the Option class.
  This simplified the work that the CursesDisplay was doing and allowed the
  deletion of a member function.

- Added a value attribute to items in-game - there was XML support for
  this, but I apparently forgot to add it to the Item itself.

- Started work on the score file.  Created a score calculator, and created
  a score algorithm that takes into account experience points, total level,
  any artifacts and their values, and whether the end boss was killed.

- Created a high score menu that displays the (for now) super basic score
  info and highlights the player's score, if it's within the top-X.  Set
  the number of entries in the file to be 100.

- Created a new tile type, crypt.

- Created layout strategies for crypts: pillared layouts create a
  particular type of pillar (square- or cross-shaped) and apply them
  regularly throughout the crypt.  Vault crypts have a locked room in
  the center full of dangerous creatures and useful items.

- Misc bug fixes: fixed a paging issue where the option (e.g., "[a]") could
  display several times.

Savage Lands v0.2.2 "Aelfwald"
- Version declared February 25, 2014.  Version finalized March 22, 2014.

- Created an external schema and XML file for specifying set areas on
  the world map.

- Added support for reading in world map areas from XML, and overlaying
  them on to an existing map.

- Removed Isen Dun, Wyrmeswraec, Stoneheim, the Far Reaches, Last Rock,
  the Far Shore, the infinite dungeon, Atua-Elar, Stonewall, Gnordvar,
  and the Gnordvar Mines from the WorldGenerator and added XML/Lua support 
  for generating these (also deleted the corresponding map IDs/extra 
  description SIDs within the C++ code).

- The Nine can now satiate with divine manna, if the creature isn't full.
  This is lower priority than full HP/AP.

- Added conducts to creatures.  Started tracking the following conducts:

  - Foodless: cannot eat food or drink potions (basically, anything that
  gives nutrition).

  - Vegetarian: cannot eat meat-based foods.

  - Agnostic: never prayed or otherwise requested divine assistance.

  - Weaponless: never attacked with a weapon other than bare hands.

  - Illiterate: never read a scroll, spellbook, etc.

- Created messages for each conduct.  Created a Show Conducts screen
  (F2).

- Added support for filtering the inventory (either when viewing, or when
  picking up, dropping, etc) by item type, as well as support for clearing
  the filter and getting a full view.  Updated the display symbol/filtering
  symbol for plants from 'w' to '#'.

- The character dumping functionality has long languished behind the actual
  functionality.  Made the following improvements to align it with the
  current codebase:

  - Added the creature's current statuses to the statistics dumper.

  - Added item quantities to the inventory dumper.

  - Added item additional descriptions to equipment items, and suppressed
    this for inventory items.
  
  - Added mortuary details, conducts, spells, resistances, and both
    current and completed quests.

- Finally got around to working out a standard paging solution for spells,
  inventory, etc.  
    
    - Added the concept of "pages" to the menu system.

    - Displayed page number info in the menu title when there are multiple
      pages.

    - By setting the current page into the menu object, and displaying
      the current page, the right set of spells now appears for spells, 
      and the correct mapping is used, as spell mappings are now also
      paged - e.g., selection 'a' might be Fire Breath on page 1, but
      Shadow Flames on page 2, as each page has its own map.

    - Created a separate command mechanism for menus (the only keys mapped
      are those for paging), and updated Menus so that they could page
      and clean up the display as appropriate.  This provides a common
      paging mechanism: for spells, text displays like Quests/reading
      books/etc.

- Refactored the equipment selection out of the Display class and into a
  proper menu.  This allows for a more uniform approach to displaying
  screens of information to the user, and will make it easier to implement
  future Display classes (libtcod, sdl, etc).

- Implemented cycling between creatures in tile selection (when "L"ooking,
  "f"iring, etc) using +/-.

- Misc: updated the string table to split based on the first '=' instead
  of doing full tokenization (so that text could actually contain '=' in
  it).

- Bug fixes:
  
  - Fixed a bug where creatures would always confirm that they wanted to
    move over dangerous tiles.  Changed this so that they never do, for 
    now: there should be far fewer dead mountain elves and gnomish 
    children.  This will be revisited later.

  - Knowing a spell that didn't exist (bad spell ID, etc) caused problems,
    so added a guard to protect against this in the spell selection screen.

Savage Lands v0.2.1 "Oslac"
- Version declared January 26, 2014.  Version finalized February 25, 2014.

- New creatures: added Iliri to the library of Atua-Elar; Skaal, Gildi,
  Thengil, Tindr, and dwarven bodyguards to Stoneheim.  Added piercing
  eyes, deep crawlers, stone golems, animated armours, iron horrors,
  holy shades, divine avengers, earth elementals (pre-existing in game),
  lich kings, hollow men to the temple of Wyrmeswraec.

- Added Gildi's first quest, to retrieve the Black Orb of Wyrmeswraec.

- Added Skaal's quest, to investigate the destruction of Wyrmeswreac.

- Added support for existing features (e.g., Fountain, Fire Pillar) via
  XML, and refactored the schema so that all the XML Feature types had
  a common base.  This is useful for setting common features such as
  material type.

- New items: scroll of enchantment, gleaming wyrm scales, the dwarven
  shield "Wyrm-Ward" (artifact).  Tweaked the evade/soak values of the
  Faerie Shield.

- Added a resistances and vulnerabilities screen (F1) which shows a
  creature's resistances and vulnerabilities, colour-coded to be helpful
  (well, as long as the player isn't red-green colour blind).

- Added the basics of item enchantment.  Updated adventurers so that they
  also start with a scroll of enchantment.

- Basic item enchantment rules:

  - If there are no overridden rules for the item type, enchanting will
    modify resistance values.  

  - Consumables (food/potions/etc) update the nutrition based on the
    number of "points" for the enchantment.

  - Wands will be fully recharged, and have their maximum number of
    charges increased.

  - Weapons will enchant either to-hit, additional damage, or both, and
    have a chance of also enchanting resistances.

  - Wearables (armour, rings, amulets, etc) enchant evade, soak, or both,
    and have a chance of also enchanting resistances.

  - Spellbooks have associated difficulty modifiers - this is reduced
    (or increased, in the case of of a cursed enchantment) based on the
    number of points available for the enchantment.

- Updated Atua-Elar to include books in the library: histories of
  Stoneheim, Gnordvar, Yew.

- Added the ability to load random items on set maps.  Added random
  spellbooks to the bookshelves of the library.

- Added the concept of "piety loss multiplication" to tiles and features.
  Updated things so that praying from an altar (not currently possible,
  since they're blocking) or a pew reduces the piety loss associated
  with praying.

- In the north-west part of the world, added Wyrmeswraec.  Added a
  temple above the ruins.  Added a lair below the ruins.

- To the east of Wyrmeswraec, added Stoneheim.

- Added support to custom maps to set random creatures.  Set up the lair
  in Wyrmeswraec to have a bunch of random insects/slimes/etc.

Savage Lands v0.2.0 "Oswald"
- Version declared January 3, 2014.  Version finalized January 26, 2014.

- Added new creatures: antlion, cave troll, stone jelly, fox maiden, 
  firebird, dire wolf, chaos beast, fell lord, voidling, witch king,
  black monk, virequus, golden eagle, star beast, king slime, war
  mammoth, black devil, hellhound, skywing, pit fiend, high wizard, 
  dracospawn, tarasque, tiamat, wumpus, steel slime, Akojo, goblin elite 
  guard, goblin impaler.

- Created new items: fencer's ring, barbarian's ring, ring of flames,
  ring of ice, ring of acid, ring of poison, ring of holiness, ring of
  shadows, ring of sorcery, ring of lightning, tarasque armour.

- Added new artifacts: Goblincrusher.

- Creatures can now die if their blood alcohol content climbs too high
  (greater than 0.37).

- Added Stonewall to the north-west of Atua-Elar.  Populated it with
  Akojo, the goblin captain, and an assortment of goblins of lesser
  level.

- Updated the bestiary to also include race information.

- Changed the "L"ook command to also include the approximate difficulty of
  a creature - this is based on the difference between the current level
  of the "L"ooking creature and the target creature.

- Updated the curses colour initialization code to be able to set any
  (base) colour as a background (e.g., COLOUR_BLACK, COLOUR_RED, ...,
  COLOUR_WHITE - but not the bold colours).

- Updated a couple of the more powerful creatures (archangel, demon
  prince) to have white/red backgrounds, to indicate auras.

- All wearable items can now contribute a to-hit and additional-damage
  bonus or penalty.

- The equipment and inventory screens now show the attack and defense
  bonuses of wearable items, when those values exist.  Fixed up some
  issues where the description and usage description weren't being
  properly differentiated.

- All items (not just wearables) now have an associated set of resistances,
  which are used each turn to update a creature's overall resistances, also
  taking into account race and class values.

- If an item has resistances or vulnerabilties, these will be included in
  a synopsis on the second line of the equipment screen.

- Updated the resistances on a number of artifacts:
  
  - Forger: added heat resistance.

  - Two Moon Amulet: added arcane resistance.

  - Faerie Shield: added heat, cold, and lightning resistance.

  - Brightblade: added holy resistance.

  - Staff of the Artificer: added acid and arcane resistance.

  - Bugcrusher: added pound resistance.

  - Jellysmasher: added poison and acid resistance.

  - Goblincrusher: added slash and pierce resistance.

  - Knife of the Long Hunt: added pierce resistance.

  - Kithslayer: added slash resistance.

  - Beastbinder: added pierce and pound resistance.

  - Skyslayer: added holy and shadow resistance.

  - Sunsword: added heat resistance.

  - Dragonbane: added heat, cold, and acid resistance.

  - Stonespear: added poison resistance.

Savage Lands v0.1.9 "Osmund"
- Version declared November 27, 2013.  Version finalized January 3, 2014.

- Added new creatures: quivering blob, giant frog, giant toad, crone,
  shapeshifter, knight, crusader, naga, cave bear, sword-eater, squire,
  rock crawler, living vines, witchthorn, treow, tangleweed, drakheen,
  wraith, sorceror, wight, steel golem, black priest, Kirin, Akkara, 
  mountain elf scholar, mountain elf youth, mountain elf brewer, Tir, 
  gnomish sailor, silver fish, jellyfish, swordfish, merman, electric eel, 
  squid, mermaid, giant crab, grey octopus, blackfin shark, wraith 
  jellyfish, lanternfish, siren, stone whale, seadragon, mammoth turtle, 
  water elemental, fire elemental, earth elemental, air elemental, great 
  eel, water demon, lion shark, nicor, white whale, bunyip, sea serpent, 
  kraken.

- Added new items: drams of gin and mead, which are contained in the
  barrels of the brewery of Atua-Elar.

- Updated the creature describer, used by the look command, to return a
  status synopsis when looking at the creature.

- Added new mystic spells: Poison, Blind, Mute, Spellbind, Haste, Slow,
  Stone.

- Added new divine spells: Smite, Holy.

- Updated Oracles so that they start with a spellbook of Poison or Blind,
  at random.

- Updated Pilgrims so that they start with a spellbook of Healing Word or
  Smite.

- Added a new "piercing" flag for damage.  Piercing damage ignores soak
  completely.

- Updated the code surrounding damage status ailments.  A set of status
  ailments can now be specified, which override the default for a
  particular damage type.  Crones now can potentially inflict all negative
  status ailments with each (piercing!) hit.

- Started adding Atua-Elar, the ancient home of the mountain elves.

- Added new race, plant.

- Created a new feature type, Barrel, and added a couple to the brewery
  in Atua-Elar.  Added the ability for a barrel to have a tap and
  an item associated with them (i.e., work the tap, get a beer).

- Added a "breathes" flag to differentiate air- and water-breathers.  Set
  the water-breather flag for the appropriate creatures.

- Added a blood structure to each creature, and the amount of alcohol
  consumed/absorbed/released is tracked over time, with blood alcohol
  content measured.

- Added the following consequences of inebriation:

  - Hitting with light weapons/ranged weapons (dex-based) becomes more
    difficult (heavy weapons are not affected)

  - Hitting with magic is more difficult

  - Physical damage is increased

  - Spells become much more difficult to learn (each 0.01 BAC results in
    a penalty of -10)
  
  - There is a chance to stumble, based on BAC level.  If a creature
    stumbles, a penalty is added to the cost of movement.
     
- Bug fixes:
 
  - Fixed a number of places in the configuration XML where the
    description SID was being referenced instead of the short description
    SID.

  - Fixed a bug where the colours for the status ailments weren't being
    set properly when there were multiple ailments.

  - Fixed a bug in create_spreadsheet.py where duplicates were only being
    detected if the creature tuple matched exactly, which meant that
    a match would only be found if there were two creatures of the same
    symbol, colour, and level.  Loosened those restrictions to match
    any level (so, just match on symbol and colour).

  - The item description randomization code (for wands, spellbooks, etc.)
    was not checking to see if an item was unidentified before including it
    for randomization.  The end result was that I ran into a spellbook
    called "the Isen Dun Chronicle".

  - Haste could be stacked as many times as desired, halving the player's
    speed each time.  This made the game kind of ridiculously easy.

  - Fixed an identification bug: the base "is this item identified?" code
    was checking to see whether the unidentified description string ID
    was empty, rather than equal to the description string ID.

  - The XMLPotionReader (XML integration) was deriving from XMLItemReader, 
    not XMLConsumableReader, so the number of standard drinks wasn't being
    read correctly for potions, among other things.

  - The code responsible for adding a creature's action to the action
    coordinator was adding it before the current turn's value, which
    ultimately prevented a summoned creature from being able to act
    (since when the "lowest value" was removed from the map and the
    others updated, it was the summoned creature's turn that was removed,
    not the current creature's turn).

  - The player character's sex wasn't being converted properly from the 
    player's input (apparently, a very old bug!), and as a result,
    alcohol absorption rate lookup was failing.

Savage Lands v0.1.8 "Aethelbert"
- Version declared November 2, 2013.  Finalized November 27, 2013.

- Added a level script for thieves.  Thieves now get a speed bonus whenever
  they reach a level that is a multiple of 5.

- Created support for calling a stat-gain function on level based on both
  race (every 7 levels) and class (every 5).  These are defined as:

  Class:
    - Adventurers: +1 Dex, with a 50% chance to gain each of +1 Str
                   and +1 Hea
    - Apothecaries: +1 Int
    - Archers: +1 Dex
    - Artisans: +1 Dex
    - Merchants: +1 Cha
    - Minstrels: +1 Cha
    - Nobles: +1 Cha
    - Oracles: +1 Wil
    - Pilgrims: +1 Wil
    - Pugilists: +1 Str
    - Rovers: +1 Agi
    - Sages: +1 Int and +1 Wil
    - Seafarers: +1 Hea
    - Shepherds: +1 Wil
    - Smiths: +1 Str
    - Thieves: +1 Agi
    - Warriors: +1 Str
    - Witchlings: +1 Int
    - Wizards: +1 Int

  Race:
    - Humans: +1 Str, Dex, or Agi; +1 Int, Wil, or Cha
    - Wood Elves: +1 Int or Dex
    - Mountain Elves: +1 Int or Hea
    - Snakelings: +1 Int or Agi
    - Fae: +1 Int, +1 Wil
    - Dwarves: +1 Str or +1 Hea
    - Goblins: +1 Agi
    - Ogres: +1 Str
    - Giants: +1 Str
    - Gnomes: +1 Int, Wil, or Agi

  - Added new creatures: mole, ghost, spook, spectral knight, spectral
    wizard, spectral lord, spectral emperor, charcoal burner, wrecker,
    woodsman, bog spirit, divine spirit, fire spirit, gargoyle.

- Added a new NPC race, spirit, which will be used for ghosts, spooks,
  and other ghost-y undead.

- Added a couple of spooks to Wintersea Keep.

- New armour: elven robes, magic armour, ethereal armour, spirit mail,
  chimera hide armour, behemoth hide armour, heavy cloak, hunter's
  cloak, shell armour, steel plate armour, dragonscale armour, leviathan
  armour, colossus armour, magic shield, spirit shield, steel helm,
  knight's helm, dragon helm, thief's cap, guildmaster's cap, kite
  shield, dragon shield, tower shield, thief's boots, magic boots, 
  steel boots, dragon boots.

- Added an "incorporeal" status flag.  This is on permanently for races
  that support it (spirits), and has a corresponding powerful mystic
  spell, Wraith Form.  While creatures are incorporeal, they are able
  to move through any tile, so long as it is not occupied by another
  creature.  They are also not troubled by water (swimming) or great
  heights (mountain checks).  However, casters must take great care: any
  creature that is in an otherwise-inaccessible square when Wraith Form
  wears off will be instantly killed.

- Updated the Lua quest code so that it properly considered the quest's
  precondition function return value prior to actually executing the
  quest function and assigning the quest to the player.

- Refactored the deity decision handling code slightly.  Added a deity
  strategy handler for restoring AP, as well as one for removing harmful
  statuses from the player.

- In what appears to be my annual development environment update: upgraded 
  from Visual Studio 2010 Express to Visual Studio 2013 Express, Google 
  Test from 1.6 to 1.7, Boost from 1.48 to 1.55.  No updates to pdcurses
  or xerces. 

- C++11 updates:
  
  - Updated all occurrences of BOOST_FOREACH to range-based for.

  - Replaced boost::shared_ptr, boost::make_shared, and
    boost::dynamic_pointer_cast with their std:: equivalents.

  - Refactored the code in ItemDescriptionRandomizer.  This was using
    a couple of pairs to simulate a tuple, which was ugly.  Now it uses
    a real std::tuple.

  - Changed BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT to C++11's static_assert.

  - Changed "> >" safeguards from old-style C++ to ">>", due to the new
    C++11 parse rules.

  - Where applicable, created or assigned vectors and maps using
    initialization lists rather than multiple push_back/insert statements.

  - Converted boost::unordered_map to std::unordered_map.

  - Began the process of adding override/final keywords where appropriate.
    This will be a long road.

Savage Lands v0.1.7 "Aethelstan"
- Version declared September 29, 2013.  Version finalized November 2, 2013.

- There were too many elf-type races (Wood Elf, Mountain Elf, Marsh Elf,
  Fae), so Marsh Elves became Snakelings, which are loosely modelled on the
  Serpent Queen from Advanced Fighting Fantasy.

- Added additional compilation details to the "V"ersion command.

- Toned down the damage on criticals/mighty blows, as these had the
  potential to one-shot weaker characters of an appropriate level.

- Valour and spirit really weren't adding anything to the game, so they
  have been removed.

- Prior to adding Lua scripting support, there was a system of "event 
  functions" in place, basically a map from strings to a common function 
  signature.  This felt awkward once scripting support was enabled, so I 
  removed this feature, and changed all the event functions to use 
  Lua scripts instead.

- Added a number of new creatures: imp, white wolf, cyclops, hydra, wyrm,
  goblin, goblin champion, minotaur, hydra, nightmare, red ooze, sellsword,
  griffin, angel, unicorn, black unicorn, goblin raider, golem, mammoth,
  skeleton king, archangel, troglodyte, troll, beholder, tentacled horror,
  dragon, sylph, naiad, harpy, colossus, titan, skraeling, black creeper,
  great serpent, deep wizard, astral horror, shadow wolf, shadow snake,
  shadow beast, shadow demon, shadow wyrm, snakeling, redcap, drakeling, 
  arachnos, behemoth, barrow spider, dwarf, dwarven warrior, dwarven hero,
  pegasus, bog devil, leviathan, floating eye, mountain elf, moutain elf
  explorer, wood elf, wood elf swordsman, wood elf sage, Ilru, Falir,
  lichling, grey glider, Lalo, ghoul, corpse bird, quisling, cougar, lion,
  cave tiger, liger, goliath, demogorgon.

- Added a damage flag, "chaotic", that has a chance of returning a
  random damage type each time the underlying type is requested via the
  getter.

- Defined new base races (animal, construct, demon, divine, dragon, 
  humanoid, insect, jelly, monster), and set races for every creature.

- Defined slaying flags, and implemented double damage when an attack slays
  the creature's race (either directly, or indirectly through a parent
  race - e.g., a humanoid-slaying sword would slay an elf).

- Created a number of race-slaying artifact weapons.

- Added a new custom map, the Forest of Yew, which will be the set
  Wood Elf settlement.  Nearby, created Lalo's Grotto, and created a quest
  for Ilru in Yew.

- Added a levelling script for Pugilists so that they do 1d(2 * level)
  base damage.

- There is now a little rectory adjacent to the church in Isen Dun.

- Added support for reading "books" - scrolls or spellbooks with text
  instead of spells.  Created the Isen Dun Chronicle and started adding
  entries to let the player know about the locations of various race
  settlements (Yew, Gnordvar, etc).

- Misc: added some support for CSV strings to handle "monster lists"/"item
  lists".

Savage Lands v0.1.6 "Osric"
- Version declared August 17, 2013.  Version finalized September 29, 2013.

- Added the ability to throw potions.  When thrown, potions explode
  on impact (can't be salvaged).

- Added a "glow" flag to items.  When set, this flag will make the items
  "visible" when the creature is blind (the item won't appear as
  "something", it can be "seen" on the ground, etc).

- Redesigned the Wintersea Keep tombs.  Added sarcophagi (available with
  or without inscriptions).  Updated stoning/statues so that these could
  be created with the description of the creature that was petrified.

- Added Ardu to guard the Wintersea tombs.  One of the crypts is now his,
  and houses a few of his wordly possessions.

- Updated the threat code so that repeated attacks repeatedly increase the
  threat level of a particular creature.

- Created scroll of recharging.

- Updated Springs tile with a temperature, returning a different
  description SID for springs vs. hot springs.  Added rocky earth tiles.

- Added new custom maps (Last Rock, and its associated subterranean
  level) to the eastern edge of the map, north of the infinite dungeon.
  Added a quest to the exile for the player to find out information about
  the exile's lost sister.  As a part of this, a couple of artifacts
  (the Amulet of the Two Moons, Brightblade) were added.

- Added a custom map (Far Shore) as part of the exile's quest.  Populated
  it with big, ferocious ogres.  Unfortunately, the first time I visited
  the island, the ogres were a little too ferocious - they would dive into
  the water to get at the player, so if the player kept his distance,
  the ogres would eventually drown.  While awesome, this ultimately needed
  to be fixed.  Ogres aren't bright, but they're not stupid, either.  
  Added a tile/tile-super-type safety check mechanism, and added safety 
  checks for water tiles so that creatures would only cross water if they
  had a boat.

- Created the gnomish village of Gnordvar in the mountains of a small
  island, north of Isen Dun.

- Created a new tile/generator type (Mine), and added a rather dangerous
  mine adjacent to the village of Gnordvar.

- Initial implementation of automatic movement via 'w' + direction.

- Miscellaneous changes/bug fixes: fixed an issue with adding a creature 
  to its own threat map (via self_attack when stunned, etc), which 
  hilariously caused it to wander from tile to tile, looking for itself.  
  Fixed some FIXMEs, and removed some others I'm basically never going to 
  bother to fix.  Added a description for Cynwise's Wintersea quest.
  Updated TileGenerator to be instance-based, as it was getting buggy and
  awkward with a static method.  Fixed a text bug with the blindness
  status message.

Savage Lands v0.1.5 "Beorhthun"
- Version declared June 23, 2013.  Version finalized August 17, 2013.

- Changed Pixie to Fae.  Created a "hungerless" race option that allows
  creatures to eat and have their hunger level tick down to normal, but
  stop there, so that they never get hungry.  Set this option for Fae.

- Updated the message manager code to properly account for the creature
  generating the message - the player should always generate messages,
  and other creatures should only generate messages if within the player's
  view map.

- Added status ailments (poison), and the application of status ailments
  via damage (e.g., checks for poisoning after being hit with poison
  damage).  Created a new creature observer for handling per-minute
  status checks, and created the mechanics for poison - 1 point of damage
  per tick.  Added a green "Po" as a status indicator on the player
  synopsis so that the player is aware of the status.

- Added muteness for holy damage (dumbstruck by divine power).  Added
  checks to chatting, evoking wands, and spellcasting so that muteness
  prevents these from occurring.

- Added paralysis for lightning damage, updating the game loop so that
  the player doesn't get an action when paralyzed, instead burning a turn
  with an action cost equal to his or her current speed.

- Added slowness for cold damage.

- Added haste status effect, and speed potion.  Made haste cancel out
  slowness, and vice versa.

- Added stoning (petrification) for shadow damage, and updated the code so
  that petrified creatures leave their petrified corpses behind.  These are
  treated as blocking terrain features.

- Added bloodied for slash damage.  Updated the code so that this status
  would cause a significant to-hit penalty for melee and ranged combat.

- Added stunned for pounding damage.  This can cause randomization of
  the creature's chosen movement direction, auto-attacking friendly
  creatures if they occupy the new tile.

- Added exposed for piercing damage.  This causes the player to have a
  temporarily lower Evade score.

- Added spellbound for arcane damage.  Updated the code so that this
  prohibits all movement to and from a map, but not other types of actions
  (so it can be waited out with searching, etc).

- Added disfiguration for acid damage.  Updated the code so that this
  status effect reduces a number of stats (25% chance for each).  Changed
  the display code so that any statistic less than its maximum value is
  displayed in red.

- Added blindness for fire damage.  Preventing chatting, firing weapons,
  added to-hit and evade penalties, and did the necessary work to black
  out the map.

- Added new creatures with various damage types for testing the status
  effects on the player: rock adder, acolyte, lightning bug, frost devil,
  fire devil, shade, apprentice.

- Eliminated three damage types (mental, sonic, radiant).  As I was adding
  more and more creatures and spells, I noticed that I wasn't using these
  damage types at all.  To have a more meaningful and oft-used set of
  resistances, I decided to eliminate these damage types.

- Miscellaneous fixes and changes: updated the player-death code so that 
  the display will be updated before death (to show final HP, etc),
  allowed normally hostile creatures to be generated as friendly on
  custom maps, added items to remedy each status ailment created (except
  paralysis), added weapons with non-slash/pierce/pound damage types to
  test the status ailment (e.g., blade of shadows), added a potion of fire
  (no effect, just deals fire damage), fixed an issue with item statuses 
  not being respected when handling spell effects, fixed a bug where a 
  creature's action cost was 0 when auto-handling a terrain feature via 
  movement (bumping a door, etc), included total difficulty in the "W" and
  "R" weapon commands, added better support for reflexive pronouns
  such as "yourself", "itself", etc.

Savage Lands v0.1.4 "Andhun"
- Version declared June 6, 2013.  Version finalized June 23, 2013.

- The botanical release!  Added evergreen trees (pine, fir, spruce, cedar),
  and updated the forest generation algorithm so that forests generated 
  further away from the equator have a higher proportion of evergreen 
  trees.

- Added wild orchards as a tile type to the world map, and added a
  guaranteed wild orchard on the starting island.  Random wild orchards
  can be considered for generation when generating forest tiles for the
  world map.  Wild orchards are sparser than regular forests, and contain 
  a proportion of fruit trees (apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear).  
  These have a chance of bearing fruit in the summer months.

- Added a dozen types of weeds.

Savage Lands v0.1.3 "Ealdwulf"
- Version declared April 28, 2013.  Version finalized June 6, 2013.

- Bestiary (a la ADOM's monster memory and DCSS's examine command), and a
  few new minor (flavour) creatures.

- Added support for wands, and added a few types of wands (teleport, frost)
  to the game.

- Changed the item creation routines to randomly set blessed/uncursed/
  cursed status, to include these in the item descriptions (though not
  the usage descriptions), and show an appropriate colour in the UI based
  on the object status.

- Randomization of the unidentified descriptions and usage descriptions
  for scrolls, wands, staves, spellbooks, rings, potions, and amulets 
  after starting a new game.

- Learning of spells via spellbooks for non-Primordial spells.
  Consequences for particularly bad spell learning checks (e.g., a
  pilgrim that badly fails after trying to learn a wizard spell).

Savage Lands v0.1.2, "Aethelwalh"
- Version declared March 28, 2013.  Version finalized April 28, 2013.

- Added support for ranged combat animation.

- Extended the scripting engine to allow for "level scripts" that can be
  executed per-class on creature creation (L1) and after levelling.

- Spellcasting: an initial L1 spell for Witchlings, spells screen, 
  spellcasting mechanics and animation, various bugfixes for magical 
  calculators due to stubs being created in the Early Days, shape
  processing for beams (regular and reflective), cones, balls, and self-
  targetting.  Various spells (Dragon Breath, Wreath of Fire, Lightning
  Bolt, Healing Word) to test the various shapes.  Changes to animation
  to support changing symbols (so that reflecting beams look good).

- Miscellaneous small changes: AP regeneration, some class renaming/general
  cleanup of strings and actions.

Savage Lands v0.1.1, "Cissa"
- Version declared March 10, 2013.  Version finalized March 28, 2013.

- Added different tile colours based on season.

- Updated the display routines to be much quicker - these update a subset
  of the screen, rather than the whole screen, which saves a lot of time.
  
- Added a warning message prior to attacking a friendly creature, and 
  added support so that certain deities Do Not Like This.

- Added Cynwise, the village witch, and her associated quest in Wintersea
  Keep.

- More creatures added and populated within Wintersea Keep.


Savage Lands v0.1.0, "Aelle"
- Initial version, unreleased.  Project started July 2, 2011.

- Version finalized March 10, 2013.

- Races, classes, deities, maps, world generation via cellular automata,
  pathfinding, creatures, items, fixed and random maps, quests (via 
  embedded Lua), game configuration via XML, hunger, seasons, unit test 
  support, display via (pd,n)curses, serialization, terrain features,
  chatting, praying, skills and resistances, movement via feet or boat,
  locks with unique keys, random and persistent dungeon complexes, end
  boss with victory condition, and many more.

- Initially started the project in Cygwin.  Migrated to MinGW in Dec 2011,
  and during a failed attempt at using Boost's serialization library,
  switched from MinGW to Visual Studio 2010 Express in October 2012.

- No version control at first.  Started using Subversion in November 2011,
  and then migrated to Mercurial around May 2012.
