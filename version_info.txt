Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.4 "Domeniconi"
- Version declared November 3, 2015.

- Firing through an occupied tile is now possible, when that occupied
  tile is not the terminal tile on a particular path.  The check is
  based on the maximum of the defending creature's Awareness, and the
  attacking creature's Archery.

- Added "seeds" to certain food items (apples, cherries, etc).  When
  a creature eats these foods, he/she "spits out" the seed onto their
  own tile.  This seed is its own item and will eventually be used to
  allow planting of trees.

- Added some guards to a few of the Lua API functions so that they
  wouldn't do anything while the player is on the world map.

- Created a new character, Nama, who like Idem can be found at Wintersea 
  Keep.  Nama records the true name of things, and allows the player to 
  change his or her name.

- Improvised weapons now deal 1d2 damage, plus a modifier based on
  their weight.

- Evade nerf part 1: half the attacking creature's level, rounded down,
  is now used for all physical and magical to-hit calculations (kraphead).

- Evade nerf part 2: there was already a check in place for automatic
  misses; now there is also a check in place for automatic hits, though
  the chance of the latter (2%) is less than the former (5%).

- HP regeneration is now based on not only on the multipliers associated
  with the creature's tile and feature, but also on the creature's
  Health score.  There is a hard minimum of 4 minutes to regen 1 HP
  in-game.

- Similarly, AP regeneration now takes into account the creature's
  willpower score (akeley).

- The naming screen now shows the selected race/class combination, as
  well as the selected deity.  Typically the user will know these, but 
  may not depending if a random generation option was chosen.

- The welcome screen now offers an option to create a new, randomized
  character.  Random selections are also possible from each of the
  sex, race, class, and deity selection screens (akeley).

- Conducts are now worth points (100 per conduct per level), not just
  bragging rights after winning (kraphead).

- Added brief class descriptions to character creation (Mateusz Logowski)

- Dropping a seed in a tile with a hole now plants that seed, and if the
  map is not permanent (e.g., it was a randomly generated field, forest,
  etc) then the map becomes permanent and links up to the world map.  
  The planted tile will transform into a tree of the appropriate type at 
  some point in the spring of the following year.  Planting is currently 
  100% successful when planting on overworld maps (a tree always grows 
  the following year), and 0% on other map types (dungeons, caverns, etc),
  though this may change in future.

- Digging on a water- or air-based tile is now impossible.

- Good and neutral deities now very strongly dislike the consumption of
  undead corpses.

- Idem now only shows you the items in your inventory that are not
  identified.

- Item enchantments were way too powerful.  Instead of using a uniform
  random number from 1 to (danger level/2), the algorithm is now 
  mostly Poisson-based, with a typical mean of (danger level/8).  This
  is likely to be tweaked again in future releases.

- For generated NPCs, set AP to be half the base HP, if not specified.

- Spellbooks have been set to uncommon, so they should be generated much
  less frequently (akeley).

- Item generation was ridiculously biased towards generating common items,
  as those make up the majority of items in the game.  Rewrote the
  item generation algorithm to generate a larger proportion of uncommon
  and rare items.

- When out of depth creatures appear, there is a greater chance for
  uncommon items to appear as well.  Right now this results in a
  preponderance of potions and spellbooks, but will sort itself out over
  time as more items are added to the game.

- Humanoids now have a base chance to be carrying a small amount of
  ivory pieces.

- Kicking a creature now has a chance to send the creature staggering
  back (Mateusz Lagowski).

- Added a setting to always disallow moving on to dangerous tiles.  Set
  it to false by default - players can enable it as desired (kraphead).

- Various code cleanups and minor refactorings.

- New creatures: Nama.

- New artifacts: ruby ring "Falcon's Eye", jasper ring "Carpathos".

- Bug fixes:

  - Idem's description implied that he was mobile, but he was set to
    immobile.

  - Altus' quest incorrectly defaulted to Christof's generic chat text
    when the quest was completed (kraphead).

  - Shields/etc could be used in the ammunition slot for extra Ev/Soak,
    resistances, etc.  Fixed this so that only ammunition adds to
    Ev/Soak/resists when in the ammunition slot (kraphead).

  - Puglists' unarmed damage was being applied even when an improvised
    weapon (e.g., a shield) was wielded (kraphead).

  - The completion function for the Caravan Master's quest referenced an
    older creature ID, preventing the quest from being completed
    (kraphead).

  - A number of monster races (undead, dragon, etc) had their resistances
    and vulnerabilities inverted.

  - Ensured that piercing/incorporeal attack messages don't fire when a
    creature attacks itself (kraphead).

  - The code to remove items (e.g., the Exile taking the Amulet of the
    Two Moons) wasn't properly handling the case when the item was
    equipped in the inventory (kraphead).

  - The game would crash when it encountered a "%" when trying to print
    the game text, because of how the printw-type functions work.  Fixed
    up CursesDisplay to always change "%" to "%%" when doing string
    printing.

  - Fixed a bug with dates in the Isen Dun Chronicle going past the
    actual in-game start date.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.3 "Carcassi"
- Version declared October 6, 2015.  Version finalized November 3, 2015.

- Shepherds now start with Weaving (AgingMinotaur).

- Added a brief guide on how to do simple modding (Zirael).

- Logged an error when unable to insert a map into the MapRegistry
  because the key is already in use.  Useful for debugging while modding.

- Soak is quartered when an incorporeal attack is used.  Typically, this
  will be an unarmed attack by an incorporeal creature, such as a spook,
  etc.  A successful hit generates a message about the incorporeal attack,
  similar to what is done for piercing damage.

- Changed the pierce damage type message from "tears at" to "pierces".

- The switching places prompt now defaults to "yes" when an unrecognized
  input is received (AgingMinotaur).  The "squeeze past" prompt also
  defaults to "yes".

- Created a new "I"tems command to view the inventory directly.  "i"
  continues to take the player to the equipment screen (Akeley).

- Made the Lua code safer (everything should run in protected mode, now)
  so that errors in certain scripts no longer cause the application to
  panic-exit.

- Once a year, the game does a sweep through everything in the game with
  an age (currently just creatures), increments their age, and then checks
  that against their maximum, calculated on creature creation.  If the
  current age exceeds the maximum, the creature has died of old age, and
  is removed from the game.

- Added Lua API functions to add seconds, minutes, hours, days, or years
  to the calendar.

- Weapons and ammunition now show the damage when viewing the equipment
  screen (AgingMinotaur, Kyzrati).

- Added a character details screen in addition to the character dump
  command.  Character details is now bound to '@' by default, with 
  character dump using '#' (AgingMinotaur).

- The game now tracks phase of moon (displayed in-game via the "T"ime
  command).  When waning/new, shadow/acid/poison/arcane damage does
  another 10% (waning)/20% (full).  When waxing/full, heat/cold/holy/
  lightning does an additional 10%/20% damage.

- Automovement improvements:
  
  - Stop on tile features (doors, pews, altars, etc).
  
  - On first move, ignore a lot of the things (features, items, etc) that
    would normally cause automovement to halt.
    
  - Turn bends in corridors automatically.

  - Added a message when trying to auto-move while poisoned/in stoning.

- Wands with a cardinal beam type (e.g., those that use cone effects)
  now display an appropriate message to warn the player that a cardinal
  direction must be selected.

- When wands are used unsuccessfully, a message is now generated.

- Each level now has a chance to generate out of depth creatures.  There
  is no upper bound on the level of the out of depth creatures, but a
  low-percentage check must be passed each time to raise the max danger
  level.

- Out of depth items are now possible as well.  If out of depth creatures
  are generated, the max depth from that will be used.  Otherwise, the
  probability follows the same model as that used for generating out of
  depth creatures.

- Added an "identifier", Idem, a wandering mountain elf.  He can be found
  in Wintersea Keep, and will happily take ivory pieces in exchange for
  doling out bits of his encyclopedic knowledge of items.

- Created a new "Questless" conduct, which is broken when the player is
  given any quest.

- New creatures: boar, blue jay, weeper, Idem.

- New items: wand of dragon breath.

- Bug fixes:

  - Fire weapon was acting strangely due to some code that was shared
    with looking.  The cursor was correctly being set on the nearest
    hostile creature, and that was being recorded as the target, but then
    the map cursor was reset on the player (AgingMinotaur).

  - The currency command was only considering the first stack of currency,
    not all of them.

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.2 "Sanz"
- Version declared September 12, 2015.  Version finalized October 6, 2015.

- Added an option ("cursor_mode") to configure the visibility of the 
  cursor under the player when on the map (akeley).

- Made mention that Witchling magic is innate and other magics are
  book-learnt (Calandor).

- Friendly creatures are now identified as such when using the "L"ook
  command (barrabus).

- The game XML now allows defining on a race-by-race basis whether a
  corpse will be left.  Jellies, constructs, and divine creatures do not
  leave corpses.

- Creatures can also be specified as to whether or not they leave a
  corpse.  This is checked after the race flag (the race flag overrides).
  If this flag is not specified, it is assumed the creature leaves a
  corpse.  Skeletons, skeletal kings/dragons/etc now no longer leave
  corpses.

- Made all rings initially unidentified.

- Murdering the ploughman in Isen Dun can now trigger a victory condition
  for the blacksmith's quest (Jeremy Long).

- The player can now rest up (default is 100 turns) by using "5".  Most of
  the usual auto-movement checks apply: hunger, hostile creatures, etc
  (Calandor).  Resting will also halt when HP and AP are both full, if
  there are turns remaining.

- Automovement now stops on Poison and Stone statuses.

- Kicking generates a message about passing through when kicking solid
  tiles and features.  Kicking creatures remains unchanged - an
  incorporeal kick is considered an attack.

- New items: guildmaster's ring, knight's ring.

- Kicking a door has a chance to sprain the player's leg (deal damage,
  potentially add slowness) when the kick is unsuccessful.  When the
  kick is successful, the door is destroyed.

- The default "apply a feature" code (that does nothing) now shows a 
  message for the player (AgingMinotaur).

- Included the material as part of a feature's description when looking
  at it.

- Bug fixes:

  - Skins that had been converted to armour were still available as
    "skins" afterwards (barrabus).

  - Found an instance in NPCDecisionStrategy where a CreaturePtr was
    being used unchecked.  It *should* always be valid, but you know...

  - Various typos (barrabus, others).

  - Dungeon creatures generated on update weren't getting their actions
    initialized properly, and thus weren't acting at all.

  - The map display code wasn't properly considering both map size and
    display size in its output routines (Aleksanderus).

  - Incorporeal creatures were able to drop items on rock/earth tiles.
    Tiles with non-zero solidity (earth, rock at the moment) now have
    null inventories, so dropping items on these makes the items
    disappear (barrabus).

  - Ensured that switching places properly checks for whether the creature
    can switch into the tile - this was triggered by trading spaces with
    friendly spooks while not incorporeal (barrabus).

  - Trap messages were being displayed when the player was in LOS -
    should only have been displayed when the player actually triggered
    the trap (barrabus).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.1 "Torroba" 
- Version declared September 1, 2015.  Version finalized September 12,
  2015.

- Pierce damage is now "X tears at Y" (AgingMinotaur).

- Added a file of suggestions to look at for each release.

- Adjusted a few more creatures to not have 'w' for a symbol: woodsman,
  high wizard, dire wolf, witch king.

- In character creation, name has been moved to the end of the process
  at the request of quite a few people.

- Stopped automovement when stepping on an item.  Prevented the
  item-related message from getting cleared from the message buffer by
  the command processing code.

- Automovement also halts when the number of available directions is
  reduced from the number available from the previous step.

- Tanning will now have a chance to also add a portion of the corpse 
  creature's original soak value to the piece of armour. (AgingMinotaur)

- Ivory pieces are now "free" in terms of their total number - they do
  not count at all against the total number of items a creature can
  carry (Faladrit).

- Enchanting skins can now add potential soak, that get converted to
  actual-soak when turning the skin into a piece of armour.

- Bug fixes:

  - CarryingCapacityCalculator was missing an entry for huge creatures,
    causing bugs related to maximum number of items (pat--).

  - Wreckers looked like flowers.  Changed their symbol to 'h'
    (AgingMinotaur).

  - Typo in a Lua function name meant Siriath's quest couldn't be
    completed (pat--).

  - Items can no longer be kicked into/through walls (AgingMinotaur).

  - Up exit from Wintersea Keep B1 was declared on the wrong tile
    (Faladrit).

  - Equipment merging was occurring for all slots, not just ammunition
    (Faladrit).

  - Documentation PDFs had a stray reference to "Savage Lands" (barrabus).

  - Brass knuckles and spiked gloves had 0 speed.  This was being treated
    by the engine as a free attack.  Changed the speed to 1 for each,
    and updated the engine to ensure that a valid attack is considered
    at least 1 in terms of speed (barrabus).

  - North-east tile selection wasn't being remapped properly (barrabus).

  - There was a bug in the screen paging so that if the number of lines
    was greater than the allowable number for a screen, the screen would
    not page correctly.  This caused the inventory screen to "jump around"
    (AgingMinotaur & others).

  - The option letters weren't being reset properly, so it was not
    possible to view all of a creature's items without filtering
    (AgingMinotaur & others).

Shadow of the Wyrm v0.4.0 "Albeniz"  
- Version declared August 31, 2015.  Version finalized September 1, 2015.

- Small revision this time.  Needed to rename the game to avoid a 
  naming-collision with open-world fantasy exploration game "Savage 
  Lands" (I should have released last year!).

Savage Lands v0.3.9 "Dowland"
- Version declared August 5, 2015.  Version finalized August 31, 2015.
  (First public release)

- Prayer can now summon divine wrath.  When the creature has at least two
  adjacent hostile creatures, the deity may decide to smite them, doing
  (praying creature's level * 5) damage.

- New effect, Timewalk.  This allows the creature to move at 0 cost.  The
  spell is broken when the effect wears off, or when the creature makes
  an action with an action cost.

- Updated the documentation to discuss status ailments.

- New spells: timewalk (Mystic).

- Updated the release build to create the executable in its own directory,
  and copy over the required game files.  Did some minor refactoring of
  the location of some source files.

- Smiths start with either a dwarven mattock (dwarves, gnomes) or a pick
  axe (other races) in their inventory.

- Ingots now have a danger level of 3, so they can be considered for
  normal item generation.

- Using a pick axe or mattock, creatures can now dig through rock and
  earth tiles.  Digging decomposes the rock/earth tile into a different
  tile type (rocky earth, earth) and has a chance of adding a stack of
  rocks/handfuls of dirt.  The item used to dig has a chance of breaking,
  unless it is an artifact.

- Maps can now have properties set in the XML.  Added a property to
  control whether digging is possible on a particular map, and set it on
  Isen Dun and Last Island Lair.

- Added another level to B1 of Wintersea Keep, a storage area that has
  been found by a terrifying, and powerful creature.

- Added a ruined tower to Wintersea Keep.  This area has locked doors,
  but is accessible via flying.  The area is no-dig/no-teleport, and the
  key is found near Ardu in the tombs.  Within each room is a powerful
  artifact of the forgotten empire.

- Made the Wintersea Tombs undiggable.

- Went through the game data and adjusted item danger level values.
  There were a number that were unreasonable for the statistics on the
  item.

- Rovers and Shepherds now start with trail rations instead of food
  rations.  Adventurers start with both.

- Added a "no teleport" flag that can be set at the map level.

- Converted all typedefs to C++11 using statements.  Renamed the "jrcpp"
  branch to "default".

- Created a batch file to create the Windows release zip.

- New creatures: goblin pelter, githra, chaosling, grawl, quaalis.

- New items: pick axe, dwarven mattock, trail ration.

- New artifacts: primeval pick axe "Delver", imperial broadsword
  "Ironsword", imperial staff "Stormstaff".

- Bug fixes: Ardu wasn't generating in the Wintersea tombs.

Savage Lands v0.3.8 "Narvaez"
- Version declared July 11, 2015.  Version finalized August 5, 2015.

- Merchants start off knowing everything about either wands and potions, 
  rings and amulets, or scrolls and spellbooks.

- Apothecaries start off with knowledge of all potions.

- Refactored the room generation code out of DungeonGenerator and into
  its own set of classes.  Created generators for basic rooms, X-shaped
  rooms.

- The player can now set the day of the year in the settings, so they
  can easily start in any season.  Example dates are provided.

- When wielding a shovel with the dig-hardness property, a message is now
  added when trying to dig (by using the "descend" keybinding) when on a
  non-world map.  Initially, this is just based on tile super type, so
  that a different message is generated based on ground, air, or water.

- Added a conduct to track whether the player ever engaged in
  graverobbing.  This is defined as opening a grave or barrow with e.g.
  a shovel, and specifically doesn't apply to the Sun Gem quests in
  Isen Dun.  This conduct gets broken when digging on a barrow or grave
  tile.

- Added graverobbing as a tracked deity action.  All the good- and
  neutral-aligned deities punish graverobbing.  Thieves, however, are
  immune to this wrath.

- Tiles can now have undead hidden in them, exposed by digging.  The
  danger range is half the digger's level to 5 more than their level.
  Currently, only graves/barrows have undead hidden in them.

- Any tile can now have an item found while digging, though the
  probability is currently 0 for non-barrow/grave tiles.  The items found
  can be any rarity within the danger level range.

- Started work on the "need before I release the source" work.  Removed
  the old, dead Code::Blocks project.  Changed hardcoded project directory
  paths to use Visual Studio's $(ProjectDir) option.  Updated all
  dependencies to use their own environment variables to remove the
  dependency on an absolute path.

- Converted the project from Visual Studio 2013 to 2015.

- Added resistances to a number of pieces of armour.

- Bug fixes:

  - Potions weren't adding messages when hunger was sufficiently changed
    by quaffing.

- New creatures: quillich, quakeling, quadriga, quadari, queen bee.

- New items: shovel, sustenance potion, elemental shield, iron ring.

Savage Lands v0.3.7 "Brouwer"
- Version declared June 6, 2015.  Version finalized July 11, 2015.

- Updated Church tiles to include clerics, laypeople, devotees, followers,
  apostles, pilgrims.

- Updated Cathedrals so that when a down staircase is generated, it
  leads to a crypt.

- Updated Site of Death tiles to include black servants, black monks,
  black priests, astral horrors, star beasts, black devil.  These are all
  for Sceadugenga; for the other deities, added zealots, bloodletters,
  dark priests, believers, acolytes.

- Added generator filters so that certain generators can enforce the
  presence of creatures with certain filters present.  Added a filter to
  overgrown sacrifice sites (Scedugenga's turf), and added that filter to
  a number of creatures.  Those creatures can still be generated
  elsewhere.

- Removed the level-based creature generation restrictions from villages
  and worship sites.

- Added some more debug-level logging to world generation so that more
  added features can be tracked.

- Changed the title poem to an excerpt from "The Faerie Queene".

- Added a new tile feature, Bed, to provide a bit more flavour.  Added
  beds to the starting maps appropriately.

- Added another tile feature, Stone Marker, and added one to Wintersea
  Keep.

- Creatures now have a maximum number of items that they can carry in
  their equipment and inventory.  This is based on dexterity and size,
  and does not include currency.

- Burden levels describe how much weight a creature is carrying: a
  creature can be unburdened, burdened, strained, or overburdened.

  - At burdened and strained, creatures move slower.

  - At overburdened, a creature can no longer move.

  - Every pound the creature is above burdened has a negative impact on
    the ability to hit with spells.

- Added per-tile and per-feature HP and AP regeneration multipliers.
  All tiles (for now) provide the same level of regeneration.  Beds cut
  the time required to regenerate 1 HP/1 AP to 30%/75% of the base.
  Stone Markers are 100%/10%.

- Added two new special rooms to dungeons to allow beds/stone markers to
  appear randomly.

- Special dungeon rooms now trigger messages that are shown to the player
  the first time the map is entered.

- New creatures: cleric, layperson, devotee, follower, apostle, pilgrim,
  zealot, bloodletter, dark priest, believer, large ant, hellbore beetle,
  flare beast.

- Bug fixes:

  - Kew's quest wasn't being set up properly.

  - Custom map IDs for lower dungeon levels weren't being carried over
    correctly.

Savage Lands v0.3.6 "Milan"
- Version declared May 6, 2015.  Version finalized June 6, 2015.

- Added a new questmaster, Wispe, to the ruins of Aeschburh, and gave him
  a quest for the player to kill four uniques.

- Updated the mortuary to track not only creature deaths, but also whether
  a creature is a unique or not, so that uniques' deaths can be tracked.

- Made certain characters (the blacksmith, Hild, etc) uniques.

- Keeps are now part of the world generation process.  These can either
  be ruined or unruined, and are generated on fields or scrubland.

- Keeps are now generated as permanent structures.

- Changed the keep symbol to 'O'.

- Added castle generation to the MapTester configuration, as well as to
  the world map generation.  These can be generated on fields and forests.

- Items can now have scripts.  Added support for an "ammo destruction
  script", to be potentially fired when ammunition is used and then
  destroyed.

  - Added an ammo destruction script for clay pots, which can leave behind
    ivory pieces or healing/ether potions.

- Removed the restriction of having at most one random village per race
  during world generation.

- Added a race flag to allow excluding certain races (Fae) from having
  random villages throughout the world.

- Villages now can have creatures.  These are based on the village's
  race ID and the list of those creatures with the same race defined for
  TILE_TYPE_VILLAGE.  Creatures generated in villages are always generated
  friendly towards the player.

- New creatures: Wispe, guardsman, watch captain, spearman, archer, young
  woman, tradesman, merchant, traveller, wood elf moneychanger, wood elf
  bowyer, wood elf forester, wood elf child, mountain elf spelunker,
  mountain elf stonemason, mountain elf skirmisher, snakeling muckraker,
  snakeling magus, snakeling mercenary, snakeling thug, snakeling
  sharpshooter, dwarven anklebiter, dwarven mother, dwarven metallurgist,
  dwarven stonecarver, gnomish adventurer, giant, giant stonetosser, giant
  earthshaker, giant griffinrider, giant cloudwalker, ogre bonegrinder,
  ogre mage, ogre war captain, ogre annihilator.

- New items: clay pot.

- New artifacts: black sabre "Bloodsinger".

- Bug fixes: 

  - The "current" count for creature generation wasn't being
    updated properly (uniques were being generated multiple times).

  - Log level wasn't being set properly from the the ini settings.

Savage Lands v0.3.5 "Tzortinakis"
- Version declared April 5, 2015.  Version finalized May 6, 2015.

- New "X"perience action that displays current level, experience total,
  and amount required for the next level.

- Cleaned up code I'd written pre-common-C++11 support that had a number
  of custom to_string functions off classes, and changed these to use
  std::to_string.  The exception is Char::to_string, which needs to stay
  when I want to convert 'c' to "c" - std::to_string does integer
  promotion on the char it is provided.

- Implementation of the "steal" script: add a message about the theft
  (or lack of money, if the creature has no money), transfer the
  currency, and teleport away.

- Support for decision scripts.  These are per-creature scripts that are
  run prior to the engine's checks for movement, attack, etc - if the
  script returns true after executing, no further actions are taken.
  Each individual function (for thieves, dragons, etc) returns an array
  of functions, and these are executed in order until done, or one of
  the functions returns true, whichever occurs first.

- Updated NPC AI so that even when hostile, moving towards a particular
  target occurs a certain percentage of the time.  This allows for
  additional actions (e.g. via scripts).

- Updated the pickup action so that several of its functions can be
  called from script, and updated the pickup message functions to handle
  items being picked up by any creature, not just the player.

- Added zlib-1.2.8 as a project dependency so that savefiles can be 
  compressed.

- Updated Boost from 1.55 to 1.58.

- Savefiles can now be optionally compressed after the initial write to
  disk - this is controlled by the "savefile_compression" and
  "compression_level" ini settings.

- The game now redraws the display after each movement when the player
  selects automovement.

- Added a new deity decision strategy, Protection, that can trigger when
  there are hostile creatures in the praying creature's field of view.
  This adds a huge amount of temporary evade/soak to the creature for a
  period of time.

- If there is now an unhandled exception in Game::go(), the game attempts
  to create a savefile before exiting.

- Created a new spell shape, "Storm".  This affects a random number of
  tiles within a particular radius, and can potentially target the same
  tile multiple times (unlike ball/cross/etc which target a particular
  tile at most once).

- New spells, with associated spell books: Fire Storm (Arcane).

- New uniques: Callara, Cahri.

- Bug fixes:

  - Drop action wasn't properly using the action cost value, resulting
    in a free action for the player.

Savage Lands v0.3.4 "Mudarra"
- Version declared March 8, 2015.  Version finalized April 5, 2015.

- Oracles now also start with a spellbook of Aim or Haze, in addition to 
  what they currently receive.

- Aim is now a little more effective, so that Bravery can be half as
  effective (+20 instead of +40 To-Hit) while costing a little more, as
  it's a Cantrip.

- The player's bestiary entry could always be accessed by typing "player"
  into the text box; added another option, so that the player could be
  found when selecting creatures with the cursor and selecting the
  "B"estiary option.

- With the exception of various spells that require their own colours
  (elemental spells, etc), standardized schools of magics with colours:
  Cantrips are white, Mystic is bold green, Divine is bold white,
  Primordial is blue, and Arcane is bold magenta.

- Added a new text format specifier, "new page" (%P).  Created a new
  in game text, "On the Faerie Fragment" that uses this to combine
  some criticism with a translation of the Faerie Fragment poem.

- Added the Eka, the Undersea Prison, the resting place of the fearsome 
  cosmic creature imprisoned by the Faerie people.  This is located
  just north of the caravan.

  - Added Eakauri in a locked room in the centre of the prison, and loaded
    the cosmos stone into his inventory.

  - Created a quest for Thengil for the player to find the Cosmos Stone.  
    When the player brings the Cosmos Stone to Thengil, he forges the 
    World-Sword, the most powerful weapon in the game.

  - Added Vigarion near the entrance of Eka.

  - Added four ancient guardians at the corner of Eakauri's room, water
    elementals to the watery parts, a pair of clockwork monstrosities,
    windwalkers, and skeletal dragons.

- Licenses for dependencies (Boost, Google Test, Lua, Xerces) are now 
  contained in the "licenses" directory.

- The Lua "get_creature" API function now first checks by creature ID.
  If that returns no matches, the function iterates over the creature
  container on the map to check by original creature ID.

- Creatures can now have associated inventories.  Most shouldn't - in most
  cases, drops should be random.  But certain key creatures can have items
  loaded on them that are then guaranteed to drop on death.

- A value of "*" can be used to indicate that a weapon slays everything.
  This should be used sparingly.

- Updated the score calculator to also include spell castings of various
  spells, and the bonuses associated with each.

- Created support for running scripts after a successful attack, and
  centralized the various creature scripts (chat, death, attack) in a 
  common data structure.

- Last Island Lair is now (more) dangerous: instead of just containing
  Amaurosis, it contains a number of other creatures, including: skeletal
  dragons, voidlings, old lords, cosmic infernos, lich kings, steel
  slimes, barrow wyrms, shadow wyrms, screamers, Taro wraiths.

- Added the artifact knife "Akkar" to the evil deities' potential
  crowning gifts.

- New items: eka key, cosmos stone.

- New artifacts: the World-Sword, assassin's knife "Akkar".

- New creatures: Eakauri, Vigarion, ancient guardian, clockwork
  monstrosity, windwalker, old lord, cosmic inferno, barrow wyrm,
  screamer, Taro wraith.

- New spells (with associated spellbooks): haze (Mystic), bravery
  (Cantrips).

- New API functions: add_message_direct (doesn't use a resource string -
  should only be used for debugging scripts!)

- Bug fixes:

  - HostilityManager::set_hostility_to_creature wasn't safe to call with
    a null CreaturePtr.

  - Saved games with traps in dungeons weren't loading properly, as when
    I'd made traps into proper Features, I'd neglected to add them to
    the map in FeatureFactory.

Savage Lands v0.3.3 "Dyens" (switching version names to guitar composers)
- Version declared February 8, 2015.  Version finalized March 8, 2015.

- Creatures can now switch places with other non-hostile (mobile)
  creatures, instead of having to attack.

- Creatures can now also "squeeze past" friendly creatures that are
  immobile.  This is a pretty heavy action, in terms of cost, because
  the creature is essentially making two moves in a turn: one into the
  tile with the creature, and one into the free tile.  So, it makes sense
  that this action should cost twice as much as a "regular" one.

- Reduced the danger level on flame/frost wands to 4.

- When a creature dies, it can now potentially drop an item.  This is
  relatively rare (5% chance).

- Added Resistances to the Modifier class, and added XML support, so that
  resistance modifiers could be specified as spell properties and spells
  could add resistances/vulnerabilities.

- The Mystic spell "Curse" now sets a number of vulnerabilities.

- Spellbooks are now common and should be easier to find.

- Witchlings get a new "Curse of Shadows" spell that adds vulnerability
  to shadow.  Sages do not get this spell.

- Wizards now start with a spellbook of wreath of flame or flame dart.

- Sages now start with a spellbook of wreath of flame, flame dart, blind,
  or healing word, in addition to always getting shadow flame.

- New "P"iety command so that the player can easily get an indication of
  their current piety.

- Added a new "Earth" tile type, that represents packed earth.  Right now
  this has the exact same properties as Rock tiles, but eventually (once
  I implement digging) will be easier to dig.  Update the dug-out 
  basement at Wintersea to use Earth.

- Resource strings can now be specified in external files.  This is
  handled by placing the filename in square brackets, e.g.,
  [text/some_file_en.txt].

  - Converted the histories of Yew, Stoneheim, Gnordvar, and Atua-Elar
    to external files, as well as "On Eternalism".

- Bug fixes: 

  - When traps were firing, there weren't any checks to see if the trap 
    and the creature that triggered it were in the player's LOS.  This
    led to problems like trap animations being shown even if the trap
    was behind a closed door.

  - Movement accumulation updaters/checkers weren't always firing after
    movement, so creatures could do things like move into the open air
    tiles in the Tower while not flying, and still be able to move back
    safely, instead of falling to their death.

  - When parsing file-based resource strings, spaces are now added to
    the end of all text format specifiers to ensure that the tokenizer
    picks them up properly.

- New items: lightning wand, fireball wand.

- New spells and associated spellbooks: benediction (Divine), fireball
  (Arcane), heavenly hand (Divine), elemental mastery (Arcane), antimagic
  shield (Cantrips), curse of shadows (Primordial), cloak of shadows
  (Primordial), frost bolt (Arcane), aim (Mystic).

Savage Lands v0.3.2 "Hussa"
- Version declared January 10, 2015.  Version finalized February 8, 2015.

- Added a new effect type, "modify statistics", that can be used for
  buff and debuff type spells.

- Updated creatures to maintain a map of statistic modifiers.  These
  are keyed by the expiry time.

- Added a calculator for statistic modifiers, to calculate the length
  of the effect (the mean is twenty minutes).  Added code to
  ModifyStatisticEffect to update the modifiers to reflect that the
  lowest a stat can be is 1, and the highest 99.

- Refactored the status effects to use Modifiers instead of special
  code to handle things like statistic modification.

- Added spell-specific wear off messages (for the player, who experiences
  them directly) and a generic wear-off message that the player sees when
  a monster in the player's FOV has an effect wear off.

- Spells with net negative modifiers now trigger hostility towards
  the caster.

- Moved Cantrips out of the General skills section and into the magical.
  Added some new cantrips with associated spellbooks.

- Effects can now read in properties so that values can be varied.
  Updated the healing effect so that the min/max can be read in from
  properties, so that weaker/stronger healing effects can be specified.
  Updated Minor Healing to be weaker.

- std::random_shuffle is going away in C++14.  Rewrote instances to use
  std::shuffle instead.

- Replaced the boost-heavy sections of RNG with standard C++11
  functionality (std::mt19937 and std::uniform_int_distrbution).

- New spells, with associated spellbooks: divine wind (Divine), divine 
  shield (Divine), curse (Mystic), minor healing (Cantrips), flame dart
  (Cantrips), steel wind (Cantrips), blink (Cantrips), spirit bolt
  (Cantrips), cure (divine), purify (Cantrips), soften (Divine).

- New traps: poison dart.

Savage Lands v0.3.1 "Frithuwald"
- Version declared December 7, 2014.  Version finalized January 10, 2015.

- Updated the engine so that maps could get creature updates periodically.
  Custom maps (in XML files, etc) don't allow creature updates.

- Increased the minimum number of creatures that can be generated on a
  particular map to half the maximum (previously 1, which was too few).

- Started adding some dangerous uniques every 4 levels (with stats at 
  least 3 levels higher than their danger level): Grubb, Pallas, Kith,
  Bel, Brimman, Gilirien, Hord, Filch, Myrdin, Alteus, Layal, Bagra,
  Alcien, Rukhala.

- Excluded uniques from temporary maps.  This prevents the player from
  being able to leave the map and never have to face the unique again.

- Separated traps from features.  Originally a feature could have a trap,
  but I decided to make things simpler, make a trap a subclass of a 
  feature, and just have a trap be a potential feature that could be
  present on a tile.

- Added damage and description SIDs to the Trap class, as well as a
  trigger message SID, and a player damage message SID.  Traps display
  a damage message only when the player steps on the trap.  Added colours
  so that traps can be differentiated on the map at a glance (fireball
  is red, spiked floor is white, etc).

- Traps also have simple animations when triggered, in addition to
  messages.

- Added a "uses" counter to features.  This is -1 for most features
  (unlimited uses) and will be set to > 0 for traps.  When the counter
  reaches 0, the feature is removed from the tile (the trap is spent,
  basically).

- Added traps to dungeons, caverns, and mines.  Traps are applied on 
  movement  when the creature fails a Detection check.  Some traps (arrow 
  and rock, for now) have a chance to generate items when triggered.

- Kick messages for barrels and traps.

- Critical hits are now more powerful, allowing only a quarter of the
  creature's Soak score, rather than the half that was previously used.

- Logging is now set in the ini settings, as is the display.

- Added a section to the Guidebook entitled "The World", which talks
  about the Savage Lands world, travelling, combat, quests, etc.

- After spending an hour tracking down a serialization bug related to
  the write_enum template function, converted all instances of enums
  (old C++-style unscoped enums) to C++11-style scoped enums, and replaced
  the template function with a proper, statically-typed function.
  This...took a while.

- Bug fixes: 
  
  - Too many room features were being generated in dungeons.
  
  - Hide items with dynamic descriptions (which weren't supposed to be 
  generated randomly) were being generated randomly, and the "%s" was
  causing curses outputting issues.
  
  - Properly considered a creature's maximum number when creating the 
  creature generation maps.

  - Updated the code to apply pierce-effects at the DamageCalculatorPtr
  level instead of in combat manager, so that when damage is applied
  outside of combat (e.g. traps) and is piercing, the piercing flag is
  properly handled.

- New creatures: Pallas, Grubb, Kith, Bel, Brimman, Gilirien, Hord,
  Filch, Myrdin, Alteus, Layal, Bagra, Alcien, Rukhala.

- New traps: fireball, arrow, rock, floor spikes, flash.

Savage Lands v0.3.0 "Theodric"
- Version declared November 11, 2014.  Version finalized December 7, 2014.

- Created tanneries.  These are tile features that can be used to treat
  skins to make leather armour/boots.

  - When at a tannery, and the creature applies the tannery, they are
    prompted to select a skin, and then an equipment slot.  An item of
    the appropriate type is then created.

  - The item has a chance of having additional evade and soak based on
    the creature's Tanning skill.

- Created jeweler's workbenches.  These tile features are used to
  improve rings and amulets with gold.  Rings and amulets follow the same
  rules as armour for improvement by goldsmithing.

- Added the ability to skin a corpse (mapped by default to "/").  Skinning
  has the chance to produce a skin, which can be used at a tannery to
  create new armour.

- The tavern in Gnordvar didn't seem to have any barrels of alcohol -
  added some whisky and gnomish stout.

- Added a tile feature, Wheel and Loom, that allows the conversion of
  natural fibres into clothing.

- Added a tannery and a wheel and loom to Isen Dun and a jeweler's 
  workbench to Gnordvar.  Added Hild to the house with the
  wheel and loom.  Added a tanner to the tannery.

- Created a quest for Hild: she needs a good supply of whiteflower,
  but needs the player to retrieve it for her, as her workload and the
  danger of the outside world have made retreiving all the fibre she
  requires a difficult proposition.

  - Completion of the quest increases the player's Weaving score by up
    to 20.  If the player has greater than 80 in Weaving, Hild will
    also present the Wintersea Mantle.

- Skinning now influences:

  - the chance of a successful skin attempt

  - whether a "bonus" skin is created on a successful attempt

- Weaving now influences:

  - the ability to use a wheel and loom

  - the ability to create an excellent piece of clothing, with additional
    (free) enchants based on the Weaving score

- Foraging now increases the chance that a creature will drop a corpse.

- Minstrels now start with a musical instrument.

- Field tiles now have a small chance to generate a wildflower or
  whiteflower in summer.

- For a bit more descriptive flavour, added several distinctive corpses
  to the approach to Amaurosis' lair.

- Misc: renamed "About Body" to "Around Body" at the suggestion of people
  on /r/roguelikedev.

- Bug fixes: fixed an issue with item generation in treasure rooms.  Fixed
  an item stacking issue where additional properties should have been
  considered, but weren't.

- New items: protective amulet, evasive amulet, hide armour, hide cloak,
  hide cap, hide boots, lute, fife, dulcimer, sackbut, fiddle, horn,
  whiteflower, three particular un-generatable corpses.

- New artifacts: Mantle of Wintersea.

- New creatures: Hild, tanner.

Savage Lands v0.2.9 "Aethelric"
- Version declared October 15, 2014.  Version finalized November 11, 2014.

- Sacrificing on a co-aligned altar adjusts the creature's alignment
  very slightly: good increases alignment, evil decreases it, and neutral
  will increase or decrease based on the creature's alignment relative to
  0.

- Sacrificing on a cross-aligned altar has a chance to convert the altar,
  based on the value of the item(s) sacrificed.  The creature's alignment
  will be adjusted based on whether the altar was converted or not.
  
- Changing alignment to a different range (good -> neutral, etc) has
  the following effects:

  - If the creature was a champion, it becomes a fallen champion of all
    deities.

  - A random deity of the new alignment is selected, and the creature
    then worships that deity.

- Angering the Nine is now a lot more deadly: it can result in getting
  one's equipment and inventory destroyed, being lowered to 1 HP/AP,
  or having a number of high-level and generally deadly creatures
  summoned immediately adjacent.

- There is now a small chance for an altar to be generated on a given
  dungeon level.

- Dungeons can now also contain zoos, which are rooms filled with
  creatures suitable for the given map and danger level.  There can be
  at most one zoo per level.

- As well, dungeons can contain a treasure room, a room with a handful of 
  out of depth creatures and an item, sort of a less dangerous version of 
  a vault.

- Characters get a bonus to all statistics when created on Creator's
  Day (September 1).

- Items that are found in more dangerous places are more powerful,
  receiving a random number of base enchantments (not counting against
  the total for the item) up to half the current danger level with 
  uniform probability.

- Added a new effect, gain attributes, and created a Potion of Gain
  Attributes.
  
  - Cursed: do nothing.

  - Uncursed: +1 to two statistics.

  - Blessed: +1 to all statistics.

- Smithing is now possible, as long as the following conditions are
  met: Smithing skill > 0, wielding a club/hammer, ingots in inventory.

  - Ingots can only affect items made of the same material as the ingots.

  - Artifacts can't be improved, either by smithing or enchanting.

  - There is a chance that smithing will improve a physical resistance
    (either Slash, Pierce, or Pound).  A weapon will always improve
    some combination of to-hit and damage, in addition to the possibility
    of improved resistances; and likewise for armour with evade and soak.

- Smiths now start with an iron ingot, and if they complete the
  Blacksmith's quest, in addition to the usual reward, he also grants
  a couple of iron ingots and a steel ingot.

- Added a new material, gold.  All rings and amulets are now made of gold
  instead of their previous materials.

- New artifacts: rune-covered rod "Light of Battle" (neutral), giant-
  forged sword "Beow" (lawful), black hand crossbow "Shadow" (evil),
  silent sling "Pelter" (all).

- New creatures: oread.

- New items: gain attributes potion, iron ingot, steel ingot.

- New features: forge.

- Bug fixes: when descending down in dungeons, the wrong map type was
  generated.

Savage Lands v0.2.8 "Adda"
- Version declared September 13, 2014.  Version finalized October 15, 2014.

- Created deity-specific crowning gifts to provide some additional
  differentiation (once crowning is implemented) beyond the deity's bonus
  to statistics at character creation.

  - Celeste: celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade"

  - Aurelion: battle-armour of Aurelion

  - The Lady: divine spear "Radiance"

  - Vedere: alabaster rod "Creator's Might"

  - Voros: titantic battle axe "Earthcleaver"

  - The Trickster: Shroud of Fate

  - Shiver: frost-covered athame "Winter"

  - Urgoth: colossal stone club "Urgol"

  - Sceadugenga: eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"

- Crowning will now happen after praying when the creature is uncrowned, 
  and has a piety greater than the minimum required for crowning.  The 
  deity will give a 10% reduction to all damage (in practical terms, -0.10 
  to all damage types for the creature's intrinsic resistances), and grant 
  a crowning gift.  The crowning gift will be either an artifact, or a 
  pile of money.  The money is only generated if none of the artifacts can 
  be generated (e.g., if they have already been generated in-game).

- Created two more guaranteed altars - a neutral altar in Wintersea Keep,
  and a chaotic altar in the ruins of Stonewall.

- Created a new offer command, used to offer sacrifices to one's deity,
  and mapped it to "O".

  - Piety is increased as creatures make offerings, and a message is
    shown after sacrifice to give the player a general indication of 
    their piety.

- Added the kick command, and mapped it to "K".

  - Features are kickable.  Kicking a feature generates a message about
    kicking either the feature, or "something", depending on whether the
    player is blinded or not.

  - Creatures can be kicked as well.  Kicking is an unarmed attack with
    the same characteristics as a regular unarmed attack.

  - Kicking items moves them one tile over, assuming that's a valid move.
    If it's not a valid move, energy is expended, but the item is not
    moved.

- Each deity now has its own anger message, to add a little bit more
  flavour.

- Refactored the feature-handling code out of the feature and into
  manipulator classes located in the engine.  This provides more
  separation between engine and model, as the features in the world
  subdirectory are intended to mostly be data structures.  Features,
  for example, shouldn't manipulate tiles - that's the engine's job.

- Creatures didn't have alignments, before.  Deities could be selected
  based on race, but there was no concept of alignment at the creature-
  level.  Made Alignment a serializable class and added it to Creature.
  Creatures now get their alignment set based on the deity's range,
  and alignment is included in character dumps.

- New artifacts: celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade", battle-armour of
  Aurelion, divine spear "Radiance", alabaster rod "Creator's Might",
  titantic battle axe "Earthcleaver", Shroud of Fate, frost-covered athame
  "Winter", colossal stone club "Urgol", eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"

- New items: athame.

- New creatures: seagull, dryad.

- Bug fixes: eating food off the ground wasn't removing the item from the
  tile's inventory after eating.  Unarmed attacks weren't adding the
  appropriate bonuses for the unarmed combat skill.  The clean_string
  function would die when the character value for a particular part of
  a string was out of range - added a fix to default the character to '?'.

Savage Lands v0.2.7 "Glappa"
- Version declared August 13, 2014.  Version finalized September 13, 2014.

- More early game quests!  Started working on a quest for Kew that uses
  the south-east dungeon.  Kew gives a quest to slay an agent of
  Sceadugenga, Siriath, early in the dungeon.  Siriath is found on
  the fifth floor.

  - Created a fixed map for the 4th or 5th floor, that will hook up to the
    generated maps.  The floor that the level appears on is selected
    randomly.

- Added the ability to eat items off the ground - the player no longer
  needs to pick up an item just to eat it immediately.

- Created a new effect type, Cross, and created a new arcane spell, 
  Cross of Flame, to demonstrate it.

- Corpses now track the race ID of the killed creature.  Eating the corpse
  causes the game to check for cannibalism, which then notifies the
  creature's deity.  Some deities (particularly the good ones) disapprove
  of cannibalism.

- Defined the crowning gifts for each deity.  For now, the good, neutral,
  and evil deities all, as a group, have the same crowning artifacts:

  - Common: great mace of Torasin, eternal longsword "Erebus"

  - Good: Sunsword, Dragonbane, Beastbinder, Alaric's mail shirt

  - Neutral: Dragonsfist, Bugcrusher, Jellysmasher, Knife of the Long
    Hunt, dragon-leather armour of Tius

  - Evil: Kithslayer, Staff of the Artificer, Skyslayer, Terror, Crown
    of Tyranny, Helm of the Heavens

- Since deities now reference items, and items are serialized, deities are
  now serialized as well.

- New creatures: xither, kalath, mirshi.

- New artifacts: Alaric's mail shirt, smouldering black plate mail
  "Terror", dragon-leather armour of Tius, Crown of Tyranny, Helm of the
  Heavens, great mace of Torasin, eternal longsword "Erebus"

- Bug fixes: 
  
  - Many creatures were missing Cavern in their list of allowable
    terrain types - added Cavern to those lists where appropriate (pretty
    much everywhere).  
    
  - Piety wasn't being updated properly for displeasing actions like
    attacking friendly creatures or cannibalism.

  - The "B"estiary command wasn't available during tile selection after
    the recent conversion to use user-defined mappings.

Savage Lands v0.2.6 "Ida"
- Version declared July 13, 2014.  Version finalized August 13, 2014.

- Started working on monster corpses.

  - Incorporeal monsters will drop corpses.  The weight of the corpse
    varies based on the size of the creature, so the player will
    (eventually, once I add proper weight tracking) not be able to 
    lift up the corpse of a dragon or a behemoth.

  - Corpse colour is always the creature's colour.

  - Creatures with a poison component in their damage type leave a
    poisoned corpse.  Poisoned consumables (whether food or potion) have
    a good chance of poisoning the eater/quaffer.

  - When creatures die, their race/class resistances are transferred
    to the corpse.  Vulnerabilities are not transferred.

  - When a corpse (or other food or drink) with resistances) is consumed,
    the creature's race, class, and intrinsic resistances are checked.  
    If any of the corpses's resistances are greater than the total of
    these, the creature gets the delta added to its intrinsic resists,
    and a message is added if the creature is the player, to indicate the
    type of resistance gained.

- Support for creature titles.  These are based on class (though there is
  also a generic "the Unknown"-type title for those cases where creatures
  don't have classes), and are gained at levels 1, 10, 20, 30, and 45.

- Added support for races to be able to fly automatically.

- Made water tiles safe for flying creatures.

- Created a new race, Bird, and set the Flying flag.

- Added a new text formatter for line breaks (so that text can be broken
  up either by line or by paragraph).  Created a poem for the library of
  Atua-Elar.

- Lua API updates: added the ability to provide an array of replacement
  strings to most of the "add_message"-type functions.  Refactored the
  Lua API functions out of ScriptEngine and into their own header/source.

- New items: philosophical tract "On Eternalism" (added to the Atua-Elar
  library), lituus.

- New creatures: pelican.

Savage Lands v0.2.5 "Eoppa"
- Version declared June 15, 2014.  Version finalized July 13, 2014.

- Added rudimentary support for reading ini settings.  The game will now
  first check for a settings file in the user's home directory.  If the
  file isn't found, it'll next check the game's directory.

  - Set the default language file (savagelandstext_en.ini) in the ini
    settings.

  - Allowed redefining keybindings for commands in the main game (eating,
    quaffing, movement, etc).

  - Allowed redefinition of some of the tile selection keys (movement and
    bestiary) to remain consistent with the redefinition of the higher-
    level commands.

- Added a message buffer to the message manager.  Each message that goes
  to the message manager is also added to the message buffer, up to a
  particular maximum size.

  - Hooked the message manager up to the character dumper, so that the
    latest (15 by default) are included in the dump.

  - Added the "M" command to display in-game message history.

- Started working on the Snake Lands, the area containing the snakeling
  village and Zaeda's Tower:

  - Created the inhabitants of the village of Sithrin.  Populated the
    village - it's less of a village and more of a mini-dungeon.  There
    are a few buildings, each of which has useful items: a spellbook;
    poison and freezing arrows; and the rune stone.

  - Added the island to the far north-east corner, adding a reference in
    the Isen Dun Chronicle.

  - Created the custom map for the base and top floors of Zaeda's Tower.

  - Added Altus to the base of the tower.  His quest will let the player
    know what they need to do to open the door.

- Created a new tile type, Air, and used this for populating the region
  around the top of Zaeda's Tower.

  - The game will prompt the player about stepping out into an open air
    tile, since it is considered dangerous.

  - Unless the creature has the ability to fly, the creature will plummet
    to their immediate death.

  - Populated the top floor of Zaeda's Tower with Zaeda and a number of
    creatures in the 25-30 range.

- Added a Flying status effect, and a corresponding potion.

- Misc: added a "player" creature that should not be generatable
  (basically, just for the bestiary entry).

- New creatures: thaumaturge, snakeling assassin, snakeling conjurer,
  snakeling thief, Kraal, Murk, Altus, Zaeda, abomination, forerunner,
  planewalker, stone worm.

- New items: flying potion, august longbow "Lora", poison arrows, freezing
  arrows.

- New spells: flight (Arcane).
      
- Bug fixes:

  - Fixed an issue where the ActionCoordinator would not be properly reset 
  on the first turn after loading a game, to a loop being exited 
  prematurely, fixed the race on quivering blob (set to jelly; was 
  snakeling).

  - Fixed an issue where world map tiles generated from WorldMapAreas.xml
  could potentially have items on them.

Savage Lands v0.2.4 "Esa"
- Version declared May 4, 2014.  Version finalized June 15, 2014.

- Sped up the crypt generation a little (switched to vector<Coordinate>
  instead of set, pre-reserved sizes, etc).

- Refactored the graveyard generation code so that it would be possible to
  generate graves over a range of values on a given map.

- Began work on Aeschburh, a ruined settlement referenced in the Isen Dun
  Chronicle.  It sits to the north-west of Isen Dun, and at night, strange
  lights can be seen from across the water.

  - Added black servants, Pirrha, and will o' the wisps.  Created support
    for generating random amounts of certain creatures on set maps,
    similar to what is done already with generating lists of creatures on
    maps created from a tile's terrain type.

  - Created a second quest for Cynwise, to slay Pirrha in Aeschburh, the
    reward for which is Cynehild's Shroud.

- Updated pugilists so that they start with brass knuckles in their
  inventory.  Kept it in the inventory and kept them unarmed as a hint
  that, long term, unarmed is the better path.

- Increased the damage on the existing artifact weapons.

- Cleaned up some of the field generation code - this doesn't just generate
  fields, but also special features like dungeons and field-based villages.
  Updated this code to also consider generating crypts, which will generate
  at half the probability (0.25%) of dungeons.  Crypts are ancient, long-
  forgotten features, which is why they're scattered randomly over the
  world instead of tied to settlements like some other features.

- The custom maps now have level range information.  This isn't used
  in-game (yet?), but gets used by an external Python script to help me
  see what level ranges are reasonably well covered, and which need some
  additional areas.

- Began working on the Fae Caravan, an area located on a far northern
  island covered with fruit trees.

  - Added the caravan master, and a number of caravan guards, fae
    musicians, and fae travellers.

  - Created a quest from the caravan master to clear the taint from
    Cithriel, the ancient home of the Fae.

- Began work on Cithriel, accessible only from the Fae Caravan.

  - Added five named black summoners throughout the hall.

  - Surrounded each by a number of creatures in the 26-35 range.

  - Added additional cosmological creatures and demons randomly throughout
    the level.

- Names can now be set in the custom map XML.

- Added new items: brass knuckles, spiked glove, iron claw.

- New creatures: black servant, Pirrha, will o' the wisp, grave worm,
  caravan master, fae musician, fae traveller, caravan guard, black
  summoner, red lady.

- New artifacts: the jewelled claw "Dragon's Fist", Cynehild's Shroud,
  fae-forged sword "Erandu".

- Misc: standardized on "screen" instead of just "menu", updating lots of
  file/class names/resource strings/filters/etc, added a new "common"
  folder in the Lua scripts and added a "creature" module within that.

- New API functions: get_creature_yx (returns two values, a given 
  creature's y and x coordinates in the current map), get_current_map_id
  (returns the ID of the current map), map_transform_tile (converts a tile
  to a new tile type, preserving the various details of the old tile),
  log, map_add_tile_exit (add an exit to a custom map).

- Bug fixes: ensured correct spacing between flags on the inventory
  screen.

Savage Lands v0.2.3 "Eadwine"
- Version declared March 22, 2014.  Version finalized May 4, 2014.

- Started work on the documentation, specifically a Nethack-esque guidebook
  explaining the game and describing the basic commands.

  - Created an initial chapter on the game: a basic "why you're here".

  - Created a chapter with information on races, classes, deities, skills, 
    resistances, and so on.

  - Created a command reference, and also added a separate "quick
    reference" PDF with just command information.

  - Broke out each chapter into its own TeX file.

- Gave sages access to primordial spells, though they gain fewer castings,
  start learning the spells at a higher level, and don't get access to
  Veil of Shadows.

- Refactored the Inventory display.  Instead of being displayed directly
  by an instance of the Display interface, it will now be a regular
  menu (like the Equipment screen).

- Moved the character option (i.e., "a" for option 0, "c" for option 2,
  etc) out of the Display and made it a property of the Option class.
  This simplified the work that the CursesDisplay was doing and allowed the
  deletion of a member function.

- Added a value attribute to items in-game - there was XML support for
  this, but I apparently forgot to add it to the Item itself.

- Started work on the score file.  Created a score calculator, and created
  a score algorithm that takes into account experience points, total level,
  any artifacts and their values, and whether the end boss was killed.

- Created a high score menu that displays the (for now) super basic score
  info and highlights the player's score, if it's within the top-X.  Set
  the number of entries in the file to be 100.

- Created a new tile type, crypt.

- Created layout strategies for crypts: pillared layouts create a
  particular type of pillar (square- or cross-shaped) and apply them
  regularly throughout the crypt.  Vault crypts have a locked room in
  the center full of dangerous creatures and useful items.

- Misc bug fixes: fixed a paging issue where the option (e.g., "[a]") could
  display several times.

Savage Lands v0.2.2 "Aelfwald"
- Version declared February 25, 2014.  Version finalized March 22, 2014.

- Created an external schema and XML file for specifying set areas on
  the world map.

- Added support for reading in world map areas from XML, and overlaying
  them on to an existing map.

- Removed Isen Dun, Wyrmeswraec, Stoneheim, the Far Reaches, Last Rock,
  the Far Shore, the infinite dungeon, Atua-Elar, Stonewall, Gnordvar,
  and the Gnordvar Mines from the WorldGenerator and added XML/Lua support 
  for generating these (also deleted the corresponding map IDs/extra 
  description SIDs within the C++ code).

- The Nine can now satiate with divine manna, if the creature isn't full.
  This is lower priority than full HP/AP.

- Added conducts to creatures.  Started tracking the following conducts:

  - Foodless: cannot eat food or drink potions (basically, anything that
  gives nutrition).

  - Vegetarian: cannot eat meat-based foods.

  - Agnostic: never prayed or otherwise requested divine assistance.

  - Weaponless: never attacked with a weapon other than bare hands.

  - Illiterate: never read a scroll, spellbook, etc.

- Created messages for each conduct.  Created a Show Conducts screen
  (F2).

- Added support for filtering the inventory (either when viewing, or when
  picking up, dropping, etc) by item type, as well as support for clearing
  the filter and getting a full view.  Updated the display symbol/filtering
  symbol for plants from 'w' to '#'.

- The character dumping functionality has long languished behind the actual
  functionality.  Made the following improvements to align it with the
  current codebase:

  - Added the creature's current statuses to the statistics dumper.

  - Added item quantities to the inventory dumper.

  - Added item additional descriptions to equipment items, and suppressed
    this for inventory items.
  
  - Added mortuary details, conducts, spells, resistances, and both
    current and completed quests.

- Finally got around to working out a standard paging solution for spells,
  inventory, etc.  
    
    - Added the concept of "pages" to the menu system.

    - Displayed page number info in the menu title when there are multiple
      pages.

    - By setting the current page into the menu object, and displaying
      the current page, the right set of spells now appears for spells, 
      and the correct mapping is used, as spell mappings are now also
      paged - e.g., selection 'a' might be Fire Breath on page 1, but
      Shadow Flames on page 2, as each page has its own map.

    - Created a separate command mechanism for menus (the only keys mapped
      are those for paging), and updated Menus so that they could page
      and clean up the display as appropriate.  This provides a common
      paging mechanism: for spells, text displays like Quests/reading
      books/etc.

- Refactored the equipment selection out of the Display class and into a
  proper menu.  This allows for a more uniform approach to displaying
  screens of information to the user, and will make it easier to implement
  future Display classes (libtcod, sdl, etc).

- Implemented cycling between creatures in tile selection (when "L"ooking,
  "f"iring, etc) using +/-.

- Misc: updated the string table to split based on the first '=' instead
  of doing full tokenization (so that text could actually contain '=' in
  it).

- Bug fixes:
  
  - Fixed a bug where creatures would always confirm that they wanted to
    move over dangerous tiles.  Changed this so that they never do, for 
    now: there should be far fewer dead mountain elves and gnomish 
    children.  This will be revisited later.

  - Knowing a spell that didn't exist (bad spell ID, etc) caused problems,
    so added a guard to protect against this in the spell selection screen.

Savage Lands v0.2.1 "Oslac"
- Version declared January 26, 2014.  Version finalized February 25, 2014.

- New creatures: added Iliri to the library of Atua-Elar; Skaal, Gildi,
  Thengil, Tindr, and dwarven bodyguards to Stoneheim.  Added piercing
  eyes, deep crawlers, stone golems, animated armours, iron horrors,
  holy shades, divine avengers, earth elementals (pre-existing in game),
  lich kings, hollow men to the temple of Wyrmeswraec.

- Added Gildi's first quest, to retrieve the Black Orb of Wyrmeswraec.

- Added Skaal's quest, to investigate the destruction of Wyrmeswreac.

- Added support for existing features (e.g., Fountain, Fire Pillar) via
  XML, and refactored the schema so that all the XML Feature types had
  a common base.  This is useful for setting common features such as
  material type.

- New items: scroll of enchantment, gleaming wyrm scales, the dwarven
  shield "Wyrm-Ward" (artifact).  Tweaked the evade/soak values of the
  Faerie Shield.

- Added a resistances and vulnerabilities screen (F1) which shows a
  creature's resistances and vulnerabilities, colour-coded to be helpful
  (well, as long as the player isn't red-green colour blind).

- Added the basics of item enchantment.  Updated adventurers so that they
  also start with a scroll of enchantment.

- Basic item enchantment rules:

  - If there are no overridden rules for the item type, enchanting will
    modify resistance values.  

  - Consumables (food/potions/etc) update the nutrition based on the
    number of "points" for the enchantment.

  - Wands will be fully recharged, and have their maximum number of
    charges increased.

  - Weapons will enchant either to-hit, additional damage, or both, and
    have a chance of also enchanting resistances.

  - Wearables (armour, rings, amulets, etc) enchant evade, soak, or both,
    and have a chance of also enchanting resistances.

  - Spellbooks have associated difficulty modifiers - this is reduced
    (or increased, in the case of of a cursed enchantment) based on the
    number of points available for the enchantment.

- Updated Atua-Elar to include books in the library: histories of
  Stoneheim, Gnordvar, Yew.

- Added the ability to load random items on set maps.  Added random
  spellbooks to the bookshelves of the library.

- Added the concept of "piety loss multiplication" to tiles and features.
  Updated things so that praying from an altar (not currently possible,
  since they're blocking) or a pew reduces the piety loss associated
  with praying.

- In the north-west part of the world, added Wyrmeswraec.  Added a
  temple above the ruins.  Added a lair below the ruins.

- To the east of Wyrmeswraec, added Stoneheim.

- Added support to custom maps to set random creatures.  Set up the lair
  in Wyrmeswraec to have a bunch of random insects/slimes/etc.

Savage Lands v0.2.0 "Oswald"
- Version declared January 3, 2014.  Version finalized January 26, 2014.

- Added new creatures: antlion, cave troll, stone jelly, fox maiden, 
  firebird, dire wolf, chaos beast, fell lord, voidling, witch king,
  black monk, virequus, golden eagle, star beast, king slime, war
  mammoth, black devil, hellhound, skywing, pit fiend, high wizard, 
  dracospawn, tarasque, tiamat, wumpus, steel slime, Akojo, goblin elite 
  guard, goblin impaler.

- Created new items: fencer's ring, barbarian's ring, ring of flames,
  ring of ice, ring of acid, ring of poison, ring of holiness, ring of
  shadows, ring of sorcery, ring of lightning, tarasque armour.

- Added new artifacts: Goblincrusher.

- Creatures can now die if their blood alcohol content climbs too high
  (greater than 0.37).

- Added Stonewall to the north-west of Atua-Elar.  Populated it with
  Akojo, the goblin captain, and an assortment of goblins of lesser
  level.

- Updated the bestiary to also include race information.

- Changed the "L"ook command to also include the approximate difficulty of
  a creature - this is based on the difference between the current level
  of the "L"ooking creature and the target creature.

- Updated the curses colour initialization code to be able to set any
  (base) colour as a background (e.g., COLOUR_BLACK, COLOUR_RED, ...,
  COLOUR_WHITE - but not the bold colours).

- Updated a couple of the more powerful creatures (archangel, demon
  prince) to have white/red backgrounds, to indicate auras.

- All wearable items can now contribute a to-hit and additional-damage
  bonus or penalty.

- The equipment and inventory screens now show the attack and defense
  bonuses of wearable items, when those values exist.  Fixed up some
  issues where the description and usage description weren't being
  properly differentiated.

- All items (not just wearables) now have an associated set of resistances,
  which are used each turn to update a creature's overall resistances, also
  taking into account race and class values.

- If an item has resistances or vulnerabilties, these will be included in
  a synopsis on the second line of the equipment screen.

- Updated the resistances on a number of artifacts:
  
  - Forger: added heat resistance.

  - Two Moon Amulet: added arcane resistance.

  - Faerie Shield: added heat, cold, and lightning resistance.

  - Brightblade: added holy resistance.

  - Staff of the Artificer: added acid and arcane resistance.

  - Bugcrusher: added pound resistance.

  - Jellysmasher: added poison and acid resistance.

  - Goblincrusher: added slash and pierce resistance.

  - Knife of the Long Hunt: added pierce resistance.

  - Kithslayer: added slash resistance.

  - Beastbinder: added pierce and pound resistance.

  - Skyslayer: added holy and shadow resistance.

  - Sunsword: added heat resistance.

  - Dragonbane: added heat, cold, and acid resistance.

  - Stonespear: added poison resistance.

Savage Lands v0.1.9 "Osmund"
- Version declared November 27, 2013.  Version finalized January 3, 2014.

- Added new creatures: quivering blob, giant frog, giant toad, crone,
  shapeshifter, knight, crusader, naga, cave bear, sword-eater, squire,
  rock crawler, living vines, witchthorn, treow, tangleweed, drakheen,
  wraith, sorceror, wight, steel golem, black priest, Kirin, Akkara, 
  mountain elf scholar, mountain elf youth, mountain elf brewer, Tir, 
  gnomish sailor, silver fish, jellyfish, swordfish, merman, electric eel, 
  squid, mermaid, giant crab, grey octopus, blackfin shark, wraith 
  jellyfish, lanternfish, siren, stone whale, seadragon, mammoth turtle, 
  water elemental, fire elemental, earth elemental, air elemental, great 
  eel, water demon, lion shark, nicor, white whale, bunyip, sea serpent, 
  kraken.

- Added new items: drams of gin and mead, which are contained in the
  barrels of the brewery of Atua-Elar.

- Updated the creature describer, used by the look command, to return a
  status synopsis when looking at the creature.

- Added new mystic spells: Poison, Blind, Mute, Spellbind, Haste, Slow,
  Stone.

- Added new divine spells: Smite, Holy.

- Updated Oracles so that they start with a spellbook of Poison or Blind,
  at random.

- Updated Pilgrims so that they start with a spellbook of Healing Word or
  Smite.

- Added a new "piercing" flag for damage.  Piercing damage ignores soak
  completely.

- Updated the code surrounding damage status ailments.  A set of status
  ailments can now be specified, which override the default for a
  particular damage type.  Crones now can potentially inflict all negative
  status ailments with each (piercing!) hit.

- Started adding Atua-Elar, the ancient home of the mountain elves.

- Added new race, plant.

- Created a new feature type, Barrel, and added a couple to the brewery
  in Atua-Elar.  Added the ability for a barrel to have a tap and
  an item associated with them (i.e., work the tap, get a beer).

- Added a "breathes" flag to differentiate air- and water-breathers.  Set
  the water-breather flag for the appropriate creatures.

- Added a blood structure to each creature, and the amount of alcohol
  consumed/absorbed/released is tracked over time, with blood alcohol
  content measured.

- Added the following consequences of inebriation:

  - Hitting with light weapons/ranged weapons (dex-based) becomes more
    difficult (heavy weapons are not affected)

  - Hitting with magic is more difficult

  - Physical damage is increased

  - Spells become much more difficult to learn (each 0.01 BAC results in
    a penalty of -10)
  
  - There is a chance to stumble, based on BAC level.  If a creature
    stumbles, a penalty is added to the cost of movement.
     
- Bug fixes:
 
  - Fixed a number of places in the configuration XML where the
    description SID was being referenced instead of the short description
    SID.

  - Fixed a bug where the colours for the status ailments weren't being
    set properly when there were multiple ailments.

  - Fixed a bug in create_spreadsheet.py where duplicates were only being
    detected if the creature tuple matched exactly, which meant that
    a match would only be found if there were two creatures of the same
    symbol, colour, and level.  Loosened those restrictions to match
    any level (so, just match on symbol and colour).

  - The item description randomization code (for wands, spellbooks, etc.)
    was not checking to see if an item was unidentified before including it
    for randomization.  The end result was that I ran into a spellbook
    called "the Isen Dun Chronicle".

  - Haste could be stacked as many times as desired, halving the player's
    speed each time.  This made the game kind of ridiculously easy.

  - Fixed an identification bug: the base "is this item identified?" code
    was checking to see whether the unidentified description string ID
    was empty, rather than equal to the description string ID.

  - The XMLPotionReader (XML integration) was deriving from XMLItemReader, 
    not XMLConsumableReader, so the number of standard drinks wasn't being
    read correctly for potions, among other things.

  - The code responsible for adding a creature's action to the action
    coordinator was adding it before the current turn's value, which
    ultimately prevented a summoned creature from being able to act
    (since when the "lowest value" was removed from the map and the
    others updated, it was the summoned creature's turn that was removed,
    not the current creature's turn).

  - The player character's sex wasn't being converted properly from the 
    player's input (apparently, a very old bug!), and as a result,
    alcohol absorption rate lookup was failing.

Savage Lands v0.1.8 "Aethelbert"
- Version declared November 2, 2013.  Finalized November 27, 2013.

- Added a level script for thieves.  Thieves now get a speed bonus whenever
  they reach a level that is a multiple of 5.

- Created support for calling a stat-gain function on level based on both
  race (every 7 levels) and class (every 5).  These are defined as:

  Class:
    - Adventurers: +1 Dex, with a 50% chance to gain each of +1 Str
                   and +1 Hea
    - Apothecaries: +1 Int
    - Archers: +1 Dex
    - Artisans: +1 Dex
    - Merchants: +1 Cha
    - Minstrels: +1 Cha
    - Nobles: +1 Cha
    - Oracles: +1 Wil
    - Pilgrims: +1 Wil
    - Pugilists: +1 Str
    - Rovers: +1 Agi
    - Sages: +1 Int and +1 Wil
    - Seafarers: +1 Hea
    - Shepherds: +1 Wil
    - Smiths: +1 Str
    - Thieves: +1 Agi
    - Warriors: +1 Str
    - Witchlings: +1 Int
    - Wizards: +1 Int

  Race:
    - Humans: +1 Str, Dex, or Agi; +1 Int, Wil, or Cha
    - Wood Elves: +1 Int or Dex
    - Mountain Elves: +1 Int or Hea
    - Snakelings: +1 Int or Agi
    - Fae: +1 Int, +1 Wil
    - Dwarves: +1 Str or +1 Hea
    - Goblins: +1 Agi
    - Ogres: +1 Str
    - Giants: +1 Str
    - Gnomes: +1 Int, Wil, or Agi

  - Added new creatures: mole, ghost, spook, spectral knight, spectral
    wizard, spectral lord, spectral emperor, charcoal burner, wrecker,
    woodsman, bog spirit, divine spirit, fire spirit, gargoyle.

- Added a new NPC race, spirit, which will be used for ghosts, spooks,
  and other ghost-y undead.

- Added a couple of spooks to Wintersea Keep.

- New armour: elven robes, magic armour, ethereal armour, spirit mail,
  chimera hide armour, behemoth hide armour, heavy cloak, hunter's
  cloak, shell armour, steel plate armour, dragonscale armour, leviathan
  armour, colossus armour, magic shield, spirit shield, steel helm,
  knight's helm, dragon helm, thief's cap, guildmaster's cap, kite
  shield, dragon shield, tower shield, thief's boots, magic boots, 
  steel boots, dragon boots.

- Added an "incorporeal" status flag.  This is on permanently for races
  that support it (spirits), and has a corresponding powerful mystic
  spell, Wraith Form.  While creatures are incorporeal, they are able
  to move through any tile, so long as it is not occupied by another
  creature.  They are also not troubled by water (swimming) or great
  heights (mountain checks).  However, casters must take great care: any
  creature that is in an otherwise-inaccessible square when Wraith Form
  wears off will be instantly killed.

- Updated the Lua quest code so that it properly considered the quest's
  precondition function return value prior to actually executing the
  quest function and assigning the quest to the player.

- Refactored the deity decision handling code slightly.  Added a deity
  strategy handler for restoring AP, as well as one for removing harmful
  statuses from the player.

- In what appears to be my annual development environment update: upgraded 
  from Visual Studio 2010 Express to Visual Studio 2013 Express, Google 
  Test from 1.6 to 1.7, Boost from 1.48 to 1.55.  No updates to pdcurses
  or xerces. 

- C++11 updates:
  
  - Updated all occurrences of BOOST_FOREACH to range-based for.

  - Replaced boost::shared_ptr, boost::make_shared, and
    boost::dynamic_pointer_cast with their std:: equivalents.

  - Refactored the code in ItemDescriptionRandomizer.  This was using
    a couple of pairs to simulate a tuple, which was ugly.  Now it uses
    a real std::tuple.

  - Changed BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT to C++11's static_assert.

  - Changed "> >" safeguards from old-style C++ to ">>", due to the new
    C++11 parse rules.

  - Where applicable, created or assigned vectors and maps using
    initialization lists rather than multiple push_back/insert statements.

  - Converted boost::unordered_map to std::unordered_map.

  - Began the process of adding override/final keywords where appropriate.
    This will be a long road.

Savage Lands v0.1.7 "Aethelstan"
- Version declared September 29, 2013.  Version finalized November 2, 2013.

- There were too many elf-type races (Wood Elf, Mountain Elf, Marsh Elf,
  Fae), so Marsh Elves became Snakelings, which are loosely modelled on the
  Serpent Queen from Advanced Fighting Fantasy.

- Added additional compilation details to the "V"ersion command.

- Toned down the damage on criticals/mighty blows, as these had the
  potential to one-shot weaker characters of an appropriate level.

- Valour and spirit really weren't adding anything to the game, so they
  have been removed.

- Prior to adding Lua scripting support, there was a system of "event 
  functions" in place, basically a map from strings to a common function 
  signature.  This felt awkward once scripting support was enabled, so I 
  removed this feature, and changed all the event functions to use 
  Lua scripts instead.

- Added a number of new creatures: imp, white wolf, cyclops, hydra, wyrm,
  goblin, goblin champion, minotaur, hydra, nightmare, red ooze, sellsword,
  griffin, angel, unicorn, black unicorn, goblin raider, golem, mammoth,
  skeleton king, archangel, troglodyte, troll, beholder, tentacled horror,
  dragon, sylph, naiad, harpy, colossus, titan, skraeling, black creeper,
  great serpent, deep wizard, astral horror, shadow wolf, shadow snake,
  shadow beast, shadow demon, shadow wyrm, snakeling, redcap, drakeling, 
  arachnos, behemoth, barrow spider, dwarf, dwarven warrior, dwarven hero,
  pegasus, bog devil, leviathan, floating eye, mountain elf, moutain elf
  explorer, wood elf, wood elf swordsman, wood elf sage, Ilru, Falir,
  lichling, grey glider, Lalo, ghoul, corpse bird, quisling, cougar, lion,
  cave tiger, liger, goliath, demogorgon.

- Added a damage flag, "chaotic", that has a chance of returning a
  random damage type each time the underlying type is requested via the
  getter.

- Defined new base races (animal, construct, demon, divine, dragon, 
  humanoid, insect, jelly, monster), and set races for every creature.

- Defined slaying flags, and implemented double damage when an attack slays
  the creature's race (either directly, or indirectly through a parent
  race - e.g., a humanoid-slaying sword would slay an elf).

- Created a number of race-slaying artifact weapons.

- Added a new custom map, the Forest of Yew, which will be the set
  Wood Elf settlement.  Nearby, created Lalo's Grotto, and created a quest
  for Ilru in Yew.

- Added a levelling script for Pugilists so that they do 1d(2 * level)
  base damage.

- There is now a little rectory adjacent to the church in Isen Dun.

- Added support for reading "books" - scrolls or spellbooks with text
  instead of spells.  Created the Isen Dun Chronicle and started adding
  entries to let the player know about the locations of various race
  settlements (Yew, Gnordvar, etc).

- Misc: added some support for CSV strings to handle "monster lists"/"item
  lists".

Savage Lands v0.1.6 "Osric"
- Version declared August 17, 2013.  Version finalized September 29, 2013.

- Added the ability to throw potions.  When thrown, potions explode
  on impact (can't be salvaged).

- Added a "glow" flag to items.  When set, this flag will make the items
  "visible" when the creature is blind (the item won't appear as
  "something", it can be "seen" on the ground, etc).

- Redesigned the Wintersea Keep tombs.  Added sarcophagi (available with
  or without inscriptions).  Updated stoning/statues so that these could
  be created with the description of the creature that was petrified.

- Added Ardu to guard the Wintersea tombs.  One of the crypts is now his,
  and houses a few of his wordly possessions.

- Updated the threat code so that repeated attacks repeatedly increase the
  threat level of a particular creature.

- Created scroll of recharging.

- Updated Springs tile with a temperature, returning a different
  description SID for springs vs. hot springs.  Added rocky earth tiles.

- Added new custom maps (Last Rock, and its associated subterranean
  level) to the eastern edge of the map, north of the infinite dungeon.
  Added a quest to the exile for the player to find out information about
  the exile's lost sister.  As a part of this, a couple of artifacts
  (the Amulet of the Two Moons, Brightblade) were added.

- Added a custom map (Far Shore) as part of the exile's quest.  Populated
  it with big, ferocious ogres.  Unfortunately, the first time I visited
  the island, the ogres were a little too ferocious - they would dive into
  the water to get at the player, so if the player kept his distance,
  the ogres would eventually drown.  While awesome, this ultimately needed
  to be fixed.  Ogres aren't bright, but they're not stupid, either.  
  Added a tile/tile-super-type safety check mechanism, and added safety 
  checks for water tiles so that creatures would only cross water if they
  had a boat.

- Created the gnomish village of Gnordvar in the mountains of a small
  island, north of Isen Dun.

- Created a new tile/generator type (Mine), and added a rather dangerous
  mine adjacent to the village of Gnordvar.

- Initial implementation of automatic movement via 'w' + direction.

- Miscellaneous changes/bug fixes: fixed an issue with adding a creature 
  to its own threat map (via self_attack when stunned, etc), which 
  hilariously caused it to wander from tile to tile, looking for itself.  
  Fixed some FIXMEs, and removed some others I'm basically never going to 
  bother to fix.  Added a description for Cynwise's Wintersea quest.
  Updated TileGenerator to be instance-based, as it was getting buggy and
  awkward with a static method.  Fixed a text bug with the blindness
  status message.

Savage Lands v0.1.5 "Beorhthun"
- Version declared June 23, 2013.  Version finalized August 17, 2013.

- Changed Pixie to Fae.  Created a "hungerless" race option that allows
  creatures to eat and have their hunger level tick down to normal, but
  stop there, so that they never get hungry.  Set this option for Fae.

- Updated the message manager code to properly account for the creature
  generating the message - the player should always generate messages,
  and other creatures should only generate messages if within the player's
  view map.

- Added status ailments (poison), and the application of status ailments
  via damage (e.g., checks for poisoning after being hit with poison
  damage).  Created a new creature observer for handling per-minute
  status checks, and created the mechanics for poison - 1 point of damage
  per tick.  Added a green "Po" as a status indicator on the player
  synopsis so that the player is aware of the status.

- Added muteness for holy damage (dumbstruck by divine power).  Added
  checks to chatting, evoking wands, and spellcasting so that muteness
  prevents these from occurring.

- Added paralysis for lightning damage, updating the game loop so that
  the player doesn't get an action when paralyzed, instead burning a turn
  with an action cost equal to his or her current speed.

- Added slowness for cold damage.

- Added haste status effect, and speed potion.  Made haste cancel out
  slowness, and vice versa.

- Added stoning (petrification) for shadow damage, and updated the code so
  that petrified creatures leave their petrified corpses behind.  These are
  treated as blocking terrain features.

- Added bloodied for slash damage.  Updated the code so that this status
  would cause a significant to-hit penalty for melee and ranged combat.

- Added stunned for pounding damage.  This can cause randomization of
  the creature's chosen movement direction, auto-attacking friendly
  creatures if they occupy the new tile.

- Added exposed for piercing damage.  This causes the player to have a
  temporarily lower Evade score.

- Added spellbound for arcane damage.  Updated the code so that this
  prohibits all movement to and from a map, but not other types of actions
  (so it can be waited out with searching, etc).

- Added disfiguration for acid damage.  Updated the code so that this
  status effect reduces a number of stats (25% chance for each).  Changed
  the display code so that any statistic less than its maximum value is
  displayed in red.

- Added blindness for fire damage.  Preventing chatting, firing weapons,
  added to-hit and evade penalties, and did the necessary work to black
  out the map.

- Added new creatures with various damage types for testing the status
  effects on the player: rock adder, acolyte, lightning bug, frost devil,
  fire devil, shade, apprentice.

- Eliminated three damage types (mental, sonic, radiant).  As I was adding
  more and more creatures and spells, I noticed that I wasn't using these
  damage types at all.  To have a more meaningful and oft-used set of
  resistances, I decided to eliminate these damage types.

- Miscellaneous fixes and changes: updated the player-death code so that 
  the display will be updated before death (to show final HP, etc),
  allowed normally hostile creatures to be generated as friendly on
  custom maps, added items to remedy each status ailment created (except
  paralysis), added weapons with non-slash/pierce/pound damage types to
  test the status ailment (e.g., blade of shadows), added a potion of fire
  (no effect, just deals fire damage), fixed an issue with item statuses 
  not being respected when handling spell effects, fixed a bug where a 
  creature's action cost was 0 when auto-handling a terrain feature via 
  movement (bumping a door, etc), included total difficulty in the "W" and
  "R" weapon commands, added better support for reflexive pronouns
  such as "yourself", "itself", etc.

Savage Lands v0.1.4 "Andhun"
- Version declared June 6, 2013.  Version finalized June 23, 2013.

- The botanical release!  Added evergreen trees (pine, fir, spruce, cedar),
  and updated the forest generation algorithm so that forests generated 
  further away from the equator have a higher proportion of evergreen 
  trees.

- Added wild orchards as a tile type to the world map, and added a
  guaranteed wild orchard on the starting island.  Random wild orchards
  can be considered for generation when generating forest tiles for the
  world map.  Wild orchards are sparser than regular forests, and contain 
  a proportion of fruit trees (apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear).  
  These have a chance of bearing fruit in the summer months.

- Added a dozen types of weeds.

Savage Lands v0.1.3 "Ealdwulf"
- Version declared April 28, 2013.  Version finalized June 6, 2013.

- Bestiary (a la ADOM's monster memory and DCSS's examine command), and a
  few new minor (flavour) creatures.

- Added support for wands, and added a few types of wands (teleport, frost)
  to the game.

- Changed the item creation routines to randomly set blessed/uncursed/
  cursed status, to include these in the item descriptions (though not
  the usage descriptions), and show an appropriate colour in the UI based
  on the object status.

- Randomization of the unidentified descriptions and usage descriptions
  for scrolls, wands, staves, spellbooks, rings, potions, and amulets 
  after starting a new game.

- Learning of spells via spellbooks for non-Primordial spells.
  Consequences for particularly bad spell learning checks (e.g., a
  pilgrim that badly fails after trying to learn a wizard spell).

Savage Lands v0.1.2, "Aethelwalh"
- Version declared March 28, 2013.  Version finalized April 28, 2013.

- Added support for ranged combat animation.

- Extended the scripting engine to allow for "level scripts" that can be
  executed per-class on creature creation (L1) and after levelling.

- Spellcasting: an initial L1 spell for Witchlings, spells screen, 
  spellcasting mechanics and animation, various bugfixes for magical 
  calculators due to stubs being created in the Early Days, shape
  processing for beams (regular and reflective), cones, balls, and self-
  targetting.  Various spells (Dragon Breath, Wreath of Fire, Lightning
  Bolt, Healing Word) to test the various shapes.  Changes to animation
  to support changing symbols (so that reflecting beams look good).

- Miscellaneous small changes: AP regeneration, some class renaming/general
  cleanup of strings and actions.

Savage Lands v0.1.1, "Cissa"
- Version declared March 10, 2013.  Version finalized March 28, 2013.

- Added different tile colours based on season.

- Updated the display routines to be much quicker - these update a subset
  of the screen, rather than the whole screen, which saves a lot of time.
  
- Added a warning message prior to attacking a friendly creature, and 
  added support so that certain deities Do Not Like This.

- Added Cynwise, the village witch, and her associated quest in Wintersea
  Keep.

- More creatures added and populated within Wintersea Keep.
