Savage Lands v0.1.5 "Beorhthun"
- Version declared June 23, 2013.

- Changed Pixie to Fae.  Created a "hungerless" race option that allows
  creatures to eat and have their hunger level tick down to normal, but
  stop there, so that they never get hungry.  Set this option for Fae.

- Updated the message manager code to properly account for the creature
  generating the message - the player should always generate messages,
  and other creatures should only generate messages if within the player's
  view map.

- Added status ailments (poison), and the application of status ailments
  via damage (e.g., checks for poisoning after being hit with poison
  damage).  Created a new creature observer for handling per-minute
  status checks, and created the mechanics for poison - 1 point of damage
  per tick.  Added a green "Po" as a status indicator on the player
  synopsis so that the player is aware of the status.

- Added muteness for holy damage (dumbstruck by divine power).  Added
  checks to chatting, evoking wands, and spellcasting so that muteness
  prevents these from occurring.

- Added paralysis for lightning damage, updating the game loop so that
  the player doesn't get an action when paralyzed, instead burning a turn
  with an action cost equal to his or her current speed.

- Added slowness for cold damage.

- Added haste status effect, and speed potion.  Made haste cancel out
  slowness, and vice versa.

- Added stoning (petrification) for shadow damage, and updated the code so
  that petrified creatures leave their petrified corpses behind.  These are
  treated as blocking terrain features.

- Added bloodied for slash damage.  Updated the code so that this status
  would cause a significant to-hit penalty for melee and ranged combat.

- Added stunned for pounding damage.  This can cause randomization of
  the creature's chosen movement direction, auto-attacking friendly
  creatures if they occupy the new tile.

- Added exposed for piercing damage.  This causes the player to have a
  temporarily lower Evade score.

- Added spellbound for arcane damage.  Updated the code so that this
  prohibits all movement to and from a map, but not other types of actions
  (so it can be waited out with searching, etc).

- Added disfiguration for acid damage.  Updated the code so that this
  status effect reduces a number of stats (25% chance for each).  Changed
  the display code so that any statistic less than its maximum value is
  displayed in red.

- Added blindness for fire damage.  Preventing chatting, firing weapons,
  added to-hit and evade penalties, and did the necessary work to black
  out the map.

- Added new creatures with various damage types for testing the status
  effects on the player: rock adder, acolyte, lightning bug, frost devil,
  fire devil, shade, apprentice.

- Eliminated three damage types (mental, sonic, radiant).  As I was adding
  more and more creatures and spells, I noticed that I wasn't using these
  damage types at all.  To have a more meaningful and oft-used set of
  resistances, I decided to eliminate these damage types.

- Miscellaneous fixes and changes: updated the player-death code so that 
  the display will be updated before death (to show final HP, etc),
  allowed normally hostile creatures to be generated as friendly on
  custom maps, added items to remedy each status ailment created (except
  paralysis), added weapons with non-slash/pierce/pound damage types to
  test the status ailment (e.g., blade of shadows), added a potion of fire
  (no effect, just deals fire damage), fixed an issue with item statuses 
  not being respected when handling spell effects, fixed a bug where a 
  creature's action cost was 0 when auto-handling a terrain feature via 
  movement (bumping a door, etc), included total difficulty in the "W" and
  "R" weapon commands.

Savage Lands v0.1.4 "Andhun"
- Version declared June 6, 2013.  Version finalized June 23, 2013.

- The botanical release!  Added evergreen trees (pine, fir, spruce, cedar),
  and updated the forest generation algorithm so that forests generated 
  further away from the equator have a higher proportion of evergreen 
  trees.

- Added wild orchards as a tile type to the world map, and added a
  guaranteed wild orchard on the starting island.  Random wild orchards
  can be considered for generation when generating forest tiles for the
  world map.  Wild orchards are sparser than regular forests, and contain 
  a proportion of fruit trees (apple, cherry, peach, plum, and pear).  
  These have a chance of bearing fruit in the summer months.

- Added a dozen types of weeds.

Savage Lands v0.1.3 "Ealdwulf"
- Version declared April 28, 2013.  Version finalized June 6, 2013.

- Bestiary (a la ADOM's monster memory and DCSS's examine command), and a
  few new minor (flavour) creatures.

- Added support for wands, and added a few types of wands (teleport, frost)
  to the game.

- Changed the item creation routines to randomly set blessed/uncursed/
  cursed status, to include these in the item descriptions (though not
  the usage descriptions), and show an appropriate colour in the UI based
  on the object status.

- Randomization of the unidentified descriptions and usage descriptions
  for scrolls, wands, staves, spellbooks, rings, potions, and amulets 
  after starting a new game.

- Learning of spells via spellbooks for non-Primordial spells.
  Consequences for particularly bad spell learning checks (e.g., a
  pilgrim that badly fails after trying to learn a wizard spell).

Savage Lands v0.1.2, "Aethelwalh"
- Version declared March 28, 2013.  Version finalized April 28, 2013.

- Added support for ranged combat animation.

- Extended the scripting engine to allow for "level scripts" that can be
  executed per-class on creature creation (L1) and after levelling.

- Spellcasting: an initial L1 spell for Witchlings, spells screen, 
  spellcasting mechanics and animation, various bugfixes for magical 
  calculators due to stubs being created in the Early Days, shape
  processing for beams (regular and reflective), cones, balls, and self-
  targetting.  Various spells (Dragon Breath, Wreath of Fire, Lightning
  Bolt, Healing Word) to test the various shapes.  Changes to animation
  to support changing symbols (so that reflecting beams look good).

- Miscellaneous small changes: AP regeneration, some class renaming/general
  cleanup of strings and actions.

Savage Lands v0.1.1, "Cissa"
- Version declared March 10, 2013.  Version finalized March 28, 2013.

- Added different tile colours based on season.

- Updated the display routines to be much quicker - these update a subset
  of the screen, rather than the whole screen, which saves a lot of time.
  
- Added a warning message prior to attacking a friendly creature, and 
  added support so that certain deities Do Not Like This.

- Added Cynwise, the village witch, and her associated quest in Wintersea
  Keep.

- More creatures added and populated within Wintersea Keep.
