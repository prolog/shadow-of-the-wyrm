DEATH_MESSAGE=You die...
WIN_MESSAGE=Congratulations! You win!
WIN_MESSAGE2=With the death of Amaurosis, you sense a change in the air - a kind of turning.  Bird song from the world above, where before there was none.
WIN_MESSAGE3=This peace is fragile.  It must be.  How else to explain Eakauri, Demonstide, or the many wars of men?  Evil waits, always, for its next best chance.
WIN_MESSAGE4=But this day is yours alone.  Songs will be written about you, your deeds passed down forever: hero and dragonslayer, champion of the heavens.
WIN_KEEP_ADVENTURING=Do you want to keep adventuring?
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE_GODSLAYER=Amaurosis whispers a word, but nothing happens.  He looks confused.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE_GODSLAYER2="What is this?  Where is the black horror?!  Where has he gone?!"  Amaurosis roars in fury, and turns towards you.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE=Amaurosis whispers a word, and you are bound in place.  Heart's Needle slips from its sheath.  There is a chill.  The light dims.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE2=Suddenly, the dagger rips through the very air, and everything is torn apart: the caverns, the ocean, the sky above.  There is a blinding light.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE3=The heavens erupt in combat.  Angels, archangels, titans - all the divine servants take up arms against the tearing of the cosmos.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE4=For in the tearing of the world and the heavens, something has come.  Something black.  Something evil and writhing and infinite.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE5=The tendrils of black Sceadugenga, released from their cosmic prison, destroy the universe and everything in it.  The world dies.  Stars erupt.
EVIL_WIN_MESSAGE6=Through all this, you are kept alive.  You drift through the cosmos, a silent witness, to forever watch the empty cosmos of your making.
GODSLAYER_WIN_MESSAGE=For a moment, time literally pauses, as the cosmic horror, Sceadugenga, dims.  Its body stiffens, its tendrils becoming lengths of stone.
GODSLAYER_WIN_MESSAGE2=You strike it one last time, with great force, and physics takes over.  You and the horror fly apart, its massive form shrinking as the hours go by.
GODSLAYER_WIN_MESSAGE3=So, what will the legends say?  Will they speak of you, Godslayer?  Will religion pass to myth, stripped of its agreed-up truths?
GODSLAYER_WIN_MESSAGE4=Now the magics will recede: the ogres shrink, the goblins grow, and the elves will sail away.  For the rest of time, the age belongs to man.
GODSLAYER_WIN_MESSAGE5=All around you, the universe seems quieter - and in the dark and freezing cosmos, something surely has been lost forever, never to be again.

RACE_2_NAME=Wood Elf
RACE_2_SHORT_DESC=Wild forest rovers
RACE_2_DESC=Wood Elves retreated into the forests millennia ago, building their civilizations in the treetops and branches.

RACE_3_SHORT_DESC=Hardy dwellers of the frozen peaks

They are skilled with clubs, hammers, slings, and stones.
RACE_3_ABRV=Mt
RACE_4_NAME=Snakeling
RACE_4_SHORT_DESC=Snake-headed creatures from fens and moors
RACE_4_DESC=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.  The resultant creatures horrified the world: standing nearly as tall as a man, the creatures had the scales and head of an enormous snake, with the remaining features human in appearance.  Cast to the fringes of the world, the snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.
RACE_4_ABRV=Sn
RACE_5_NAME=Fae
RACE_5_SHORT_DESC=Last remnants of the ancient fair folk
RACE_5_DESC=The Fae are the remnants of the so-called faerie folk that lived in the world far before the elves.  They require neither food nor drink, but enjoy both, holding great feasts deep within ancient forests.  Time has brought down the Fae, and few remain.  Those that do tend to travel together in caravans through the most inhospitable of terrain, keeping their company close and blocking out the rest of the world.  Fae are stealthy tricksters, and tremendously skilled with magic.
RACE_5_ABRV=Fa
RACE_6_NAME=Dwarf
RACE_6_SHORT_DESC=Strong and stout, from deep beneath the earth
RACE_6_DESC=Dwarves live deep within mountains, far below the naturally-occurring caverns and caves that serve as the entranceways.

Dwarves are skilled with axes, hammers and crossbows
RACE_6_ABRV=Dw
RACE_7_NAME=Goblin

RACE_7_DESC=Goblins are short, cunning humanoids with sharp features and sharper teeth.

RACE_7_ABRV=Gb
RACE_8_NAME=Ogre
RACE_8_SHORT_DESC=Huge tribal creatures devoted to destruction and chaos
RACE_8_DESC=Ogres are huge and thickly-built, with the strength of many men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures' fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.

RACE_8_ABRV=Og
RACE_9_NAME=Giant
RACE_9_SHORT_DESC=Descendents of those that waged war against the fae
RACE_9_DESC=Though they are often seen as creatures of chaos by the unfamiliar, Giants are even older than the elves, and warred with the faerie folk when the world was still young.  Massive and tremendously strong, they stand three times as tall as the tallest man.  They live in the outer reaches of the world, where their settlements are constantly under attack by goblins and ogres, whom they hate. Giants prefer large, stone clubs, though when these are unavailable, a small tree will often do.
RACE_9_ABRV=Gi
RACE_10_NAME=Gnome

RACE_10_DESC=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.

CLASS_6_ABRV=Mi
CLASS_7_NAME=Noble
CLASS_7_SHORT_DESC=Natural-born rulers
CLASS_7_DESC=Nobles are born of privilege and money.  Lords and Ladies, Kings and Queens, Thanes and Chiefs; all are examples of the fortunate nobility.

Often, they take military training, to better lead their people to victory.
CLASS_7_ABRV=No
CLASS_8_NAME=Oracle
CLASS_8_SHORT_DESC=Seers and soothsayers
CLASS_8_DESC=Oracles possess a keen sense of the future and present, and can see things that others can't: happiness, true love, long life; but also hexes, illnesses, and death.

CLASS_11_NAME=Rover
CLASS_11_SHORT_DESC=Wanderers of the wild
CLASS_11_DESC=Rovers are solitary figures who spend the majority of their lives in the wild.

They spurn a life of comfort and prefer instead a life outdoors, surviving in the most inhospital parts of the world.
CLASS_11_ABRV=Ro
CLASS_12_NAME=Sage
CLASS_12_SHORT_DESC=Scholars of ancient knowledge
CLASS_12_DESC=Sages are scholars.  They study the seen and unseen to the exclusion of all else.  Sages are thin and frail.

CLASS_12_ABRV=Sg
CLASS_13_NAME=Seafarer
CLASS_13_SHORT_DESC=Sailors, fishers, and pirates
CLASS_13_DESC=Seafarers are drawn to the open water.  They make their living travelling the rivers and oceans, spurning a life on land.  The weather hardens them, and they are better able to withstand the rigors of cold.  Fishers, pirates, and sailors are all examples of Seafarers.
CLASS_13_ABRV=Sa
CLASS_14_NAME=Shepherd
CLASS_14_SHORT_DESC=Humble sheep-tenders

CLASS_14_ABRV=Sh

CLASS_15_SHORT_DESC=Forgers of armour and blades
CLASS_15_DESC=Smiths are artisans and craftsmen.  Using their bellows, hammers, and anvils, they are able to improve upon weapons and armour, able to turn the most mediocre example into a masterpiece.  From spending a lifetime in front of the forge, they are bothered little by great heat.

CLASS_17_SHORT_DESC=Champions of armed combat
CLASS_17_DESC=Warriors include soldiers, barbarians, nomads, and sell-swords.  Some learn their skills by military training, while others learn simply through survival.  Coming from many walks of life, they all have skill in close combat.

CLASS_18_SHORT_DESC=Primordial sorcerors

CLASS_19_ABRV=Wz
THRALL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thrall
THRALL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thrall
THRALL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thrall stares at you with burning, lifeless eyes.
THRALL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thralls are undead made from the fresh corpses of the recently fallen. They resemble their former selves, though the colour of the skin fades, becoming a sickly yellow to grey.  Lacking the coordination of the living, they move slowly, but lose none of their former strength.  Due to the ease of animation, they are popular slaves and guards to black wizards, often carrying large axes to great effect.
SPOOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spook
SPOOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spook
SPOOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wispy, transparent patch of light, barely visible to the naked eye, the spook is a malevolent and mischievous spirit, often thought to be the remaining spirit of a child or half-wit.  Spooks crash about, creating a terrible noise.  They rampage through villages, breaking pots and pitchers, knocking clothes off lines, and harassing animals.  They rarely stay in one place long, causing brief havoc and then leaving before the residents can summon their wizard or priest.
SPOOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spook makes a terrible racket.
CHARCOAL_BURNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=charcoal burner
CHARCOAL_BURNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a charcoal burner
CHARCOAL_BURNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the forests around civilization, the charcoal burners ply their trade.  Clearing paths through the woodlands, they make great piles of wood, and then slowly burn them from within to create charcoal.  The wood-piles must be watched constantly to ensure the burn is at the correct rate; to do so, charcoal burners set up small huts nearby, where they live temporarily, catching sleep where they can.  When the process is complete, the charcoal is sold to the local villages, the burners pocketing their pittance before they return to the forests to watch their fires once more.
CHARCOAL_BURNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The charcoal burner nods at you.
ANIMATED_BROOM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=animated broom
ANIMATED_BROOM_DESCRIPTION_SID=an animated broom
ANIMATED_BROOM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Nobody is quite sure who started to animate brooms - perhaps it was a safer alternative to rapiers? - but it has become something of a rite of passage for apprentice wizards.  Typically used to avoid one's daily chores, the brooms sweep mindlessly, vigorously attacking dirt and dust.  Sadly for most adventurers, they happen to be covered in filth and grime, and so tend to find the brooms aggressive and volatile.
WRECKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wrecker
WRECKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wrecker
WRECKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wreckers specialize in the retrieval of goods from shipwrecks; when there are none to be found, they will set about drumming up business.  Setting up false lights on rocky shorelines, wreckers lure ships into shoals to incapacitate the ship.  Once this is done, the crew of wreckers will move in by rowboat, deal with the crew appropriately, and then repossess the goods.  Given the general unpopularity of this practice in coastal communities, however, some wreckers need to move inland to avoid justice, and supplement wrecking with thievery and other criminal practices.
WRECKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wrecker grins at you, his teeth chipped and yellow.
WOODSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=woodsman
WOODSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a woodsman
WOODSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Woodsmen live apart from civilization.  Having chosen a life of solitude, they live deep in forests, cutting down trees, tending to the woods, and making a living off the land.  They are strong and tough, living in small caves or under lean-tos, snaring rabbits and hunting deer.  Those that live near elven woods are typically friendly with their sylvan neighbours.  They will cut down trees for the elves, and in return, receive useful tools such as bows, arrows, or long hunting-spears.  The less solitary woodsmen will sometimes even spend time with the wood-elves, sharing their food and learning a few words in the elven tongue.
WOODSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The woodsman grunts at you.
XITHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=xither
XITHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a xither
XITHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A lesser extradimensional creature, the xither most closely resembles a starfish.  Its five tendrils connect to form a point, but little else.  Its body seems to be formed of darkness, or some kind of dimming of the light.  They are, as best anyone can tell, almost purely reactive, showing little signs of intelligence.  Despite this, xithers are popular among wizards as familiars, being otherworldly but also requiring little to no upkeep when compared to the traditional choices such as toads, cats, and rats.
XITHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The xither rears back on one of its inky tendrils.
KALATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kalath
KALATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kalath
KALATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mistaken by many as the embodiment of a spirit, a kind of will o' the wisp, the kalath is actually something much more ancient.  Residing on higher dimensions of existence, kalathi are small, intense balls of light.  Normally docile, when cornered, kalathi attack with bursts of pure electricity, powerful shocks that can stun or even kill.
KALATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kalathi crackles and pops.
MIRSHI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mirshi
MIRSHI_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mirshi
MIRSHI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A lesser extra-terrestrial being, the mirshi does not appear to have a physical form, but manifests itself in the world as a shimmering ball of force.  Capricious and wildly unpredictable, mirshi strike with the force of an unseen mace or hammer.  Sages and sorcerors consider them unsuitable for familiars, as a number of ambitious spellcasters have been found dead, bruised and bleeding, after attempting to bind a mirshi to their will.
MIRSHI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mirshi shimmers and dances.
BOG_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bog spirit
BOG_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bog spirit
BOG_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The nomads that live near marshes tell of strange lights that appear quickly, shifting quickly.  Spirits of the dead that coalesce with marsh gas and foul air, bog spirits are often found in fens and wetlands, but are restless, and often wander elsewhere.  Bog spirits attack by enveloping, cloaking their victims in a cloud of acidic gases, floating away from a small pile of bones and armour.
BOG_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A strange hissing sound rushes from the bog spirit.
FORK_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fork bug
FORK_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fork bug
FORK_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, scuttling insect, the fork bug grows to the size of a grown man's hand.  They are so-named for two reasons: first, for their razor-sharp pincers, capable of piercing the thickest steel; and second, for their alarming ability to instantly split and regrow a perfect copy.  Many a hapless adventurer has looked back in a seemingly endless dungeon, only to find a swarm of bright green insects approaching like a rising tide.
DIVINE_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=divine spirit
DIVINE_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a divine spirit
DIVINE_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Divine spirits are the ghosts of the most holy - priests, martyrs, saints.  They inhabit holy sites such as the ruins of churches and temples.  Held to the earth by their faith, divine spirits help out travellers and the devout, while lashing out at the wicked.  Eventually, they are called to the heavens by the Nine, granted leave of the earth for the promises of the life beyond.
DIVINE_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The divine spirit whispers something in an ethereal language.
PUCA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=puca
PUCA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a puca
PUCA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A mischievous, shapeshifting creature, the puca is said to take many forms.  It often appears as a common animal such as a cat, songbird, or billy goat, but can also morph and appear mostly human.  When it does so, it is typically imperfect, retaining some measure of its previous form: cat-ears, perhaps, or a bit of plumage.  The puca is said to be unspeaking.  Although it is known to laugh, it is not known whether it can talk, and if it can, its voice has never been heard.
PUCA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The puca laughs gaily.
TENTACLED_SPIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tentacled spider
TENTACLED_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tentacled spider
TENTACLED_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A magical creation whose genesis is lost to history, tentacled spiders are similar to tarantulas in size.  However, they lack an arachnid's legs.  In place, they have a writhing mass of tentacles, which they use to propel themselves at great speed.  They possess a powerful poison, disproportionately strong for their size, and their aggressive nature makes them greatly feared.
TENTACLED_SPIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tentacled spider squelches and chitters.
FIRE_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire spirit
FIRE_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire spirit
FIRE_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers of the Nine believe that the manner of one's life and subsequent death determines one's ultimate course.  Those of clean conscience pass quickly into the next life, but those with fetters are forced to wander as spirits.  It is believed that the particularly vicious and angry become trapped after death, their rage and spiritual essence distilled until it burns like fire.  Fire spirits are said to be these people: violent, anguished, and destructive, they take delight in pain and suffering, eager to attack any living creature that should cross their path.
FIRE_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire spirit howls and rages.
GARGOYLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gargoyle
GARGOYLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gargoyle
GARGOYLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Lesser demons from the black plains, gargoyles resemble the grotesque creatures that decorate castles and palaces.  Standing somewhere between the height of a child and a man, gargoyles walk slowly, with a pronounced hunch.  Their skin is a dull grey, and very hard, resembling stone.  They are not unintelligent, but come to decisions slowly.  But once they make up their minds, they act decisively, and with a forceful stubbornness.
GARGOYLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gargoyle regards you stiffly.
CHANGELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=changeling
CHANGELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a changeling
CHANGELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In mythology, changelings were said to be small fairies or elves left in place of children in the cradle.  As with many myths, there is an element of truth to this, though it is not entirely correct.  Changelings are not of elven-kind, but instead an ancient race of their own.  Full grown, they look like human children, and they steal children from their rooms at night, dashing their heads on rocks and then taking their place.  They are able, by some sort of glamour, to alter their appearance, and this allows them to mimic the child.  But their magic is imperfect, and a mother's instinct unshakable, and so it is difficult to maintain the illusion for long.  Many a grieving father has found the corpse of their lost child, bringing it home to stare face-to-face with the evil changeling that took its place.
CHANGELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The changeling speaks to you in some unknowable tongue.
BOAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=boar
BOAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a boar
BOAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wilder, larger versions of the domesticated pig, boars range in shape and size.  Some are barely larger than a dog, while others, left unattended, can grow to the size of a small pony.  They are adaptable creatures, living in fields, forests, near or far from civilization.  They are omnivores, typically eating vegetation, but also happy to scavenge, or even attack other mammals in certain circumstances.
BOAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The boar grunts and snorts.
GLOAMING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gloaming
GLOAMING_DESCRIPTION_SID=the gloaming
GLOAMING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Often thought to be some sort of spirit, individual gloamings have recently been proven through mathematical models to be the three dimensional manifestation of some strange, singular being.  So-called because of their resemblance to the sky at twilight, they appear as a dim and shimmering light.  Their touch is strangely cold, and is known to afflict the victim with slowness and blindness.  Fairly slow themselves, gloamings are not seen as incredibly dangerous, but monsters have been known to use them as cover, waiting for the victim to be incapacitated before moving in for the kill.
GLOAMING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gloaming shimmers softly.
PALLAS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pallas
PALLAS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pallas
PALLAS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=After receiving both martial and religious training in Atua-Elar, Pallas turned his back on his mountain elf brethren.  Rejecting The Lady to join the Black Ogre's hordes, he wanders the world, leaving a steady trail of death and destruction in his wake.  Abnormally tall for an elf, standing a full six and a half feet, some have whispered that surely he must have some Ogre or Giant in his lineage.  He wears a combination of hides and scraps of mail, and strapped to his back, a greatsword - a heavy, ugly thing that he brings to bear with ferocity and hate against everything in his way.
PALLAS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Pallas grimaces at you, his eyes two shards of ice.
GRUBB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Grubb
GRUBB_DESCRIPTION_SID=Grubb
GRUBB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most goblins are short, nimble, and cunning.  Grubb is none of these things.  Large, lumbering, slow, and incredibly stupid, Grubb nonetheless maintains a goblin's love of senseless and terrifying violence.  Walking with a permanent limp, he carries with him a very large, very sharp knife.  This he puts to use at every opportunity: against wildlife, livestock, and just about anything slower than him.
GRUBB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Grubb exclaims, "What!"
SHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shale
SHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shale
SHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A whisper-thin wood elf, Shale takes her adventuring name from her mottled, dark grey cloak.  Imbued with some kind of protective magic, it seems to waver slightly in the light, and allows her to blend very well against the dimness of dungeon walls.  Smart enough, Shale has mastered a few spells, and uses them to great effect, summoning healing energies when wounded, and conjuring great puffs of flame.  Her prized possession is her long knife.  Ash-handled, iron-bladed, it seems to smoulder when it cuts the air.
SHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Shale screams, "Eat flaming death, adventurer!"
WULF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wulf
WULF_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wulf
WULF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An adventurer from the tribe of the Isenlings, Wulf dresses for the harsh climate of his people.  Over top of his boiled leather armour he wears a cloak of wolf and bear skins, and underneath, heavy wool clothes.  He carries as well a long, balanced spear, which doubles as a staff: a quick learner, Wulf has picked up a number of cantrips and hedge magics during his travels, which he uses with cunning efficiency.
WULF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Wulf exclaims, "Hwaet!"
KITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kith
KITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kith
KITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wandering priest, Kith is a snakeling cast out of the Snake Lands for his heretical views on the divine.  Unlike the rest of his race, fervent followers of the dark three, Kith is a devout priest of the Trickster.  Taking a severe interpretation of the Trickster's religious texts, Kith attempts to bring balance by way of the sword, slaying good and evil alike in his quest to bring stability to the world.
KITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kith hisses, "With your death, some balance shall be restored to this world!"
BEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bel
BEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bel
BEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in loose, dirty clothing, Bel looks more like a beggar or pauper than a known thief and scoundrel.  But that is perhaps his purpose: masking his fae features by some sort of glamour, he stands a little over five feet tall, skinny, his hair wild and matted with leaves.  Over the top of his right boot pokes the handle of a slim knife.  Despite his short stature his voice is deep and rich, the sort of bass coveted by the great choirs of the churches to Celeste.  It is likely, though, given his long list of crimes, that that is a career he is not likely to choose anytime soon.
BEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Bel grins and laughs.
GILIRIEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gilirien
GILIRIEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gilirien
GILIRIEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Filled with wanderlust at a young age, Gilirien left the forests of her people to study magic in the central lands, apprenticing with the great wizards.  Excelling quickly, she shot through the ranks and earned her staff.  But rather than settle in a community as their wizard, she chose to wander the world instead.  For as much as she loves magic, she loves treasure even more.  Underneath her simple robes she wears an ancient mail coat.  Tucked into her belt is an old dwarven dagger, infused with magic.  She lugs about her treasures in an old leather backpack, carrying the contents of her life on her back, never staying for long.
GILIRIEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Gilirien conjures a wisp of flame at the end of his staff.
BRIMMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Brimman
BRIMMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Brimman
BRIMMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the human tribesmen from the far-flung outer isles, Brimman was formerly a sailor working a whaling boat to bring home winter meat.  But his vessel capsized, and all the men drowned - all save Brimman.  His dreams were terrifying, filled with visions of cold blackness, undersea terrors, and the voice of the White Queen, Shiver.  He woke up days later, parched, hypothermic.  Though he survived, his life came at a terrible cost: endless servitude to the White Queen, preaching her cold words wherever he went.  In exchange for this, Shiver gifted him with ancient magics, allowing Brimman to summon terrifying winds and cold.
BRIMMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Brimman hisses, his voice salty and cold.
HORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hord
HORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hord
HORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great, black-skinned ogre, Hord stoops low with a permanent hunch, his hands almost brushing the ground.  Despite his slow shamble, Hord's name is known throughout the outer lands, spoken with a combination of reverence and fear.  The goblins call him headcrusher, for his favourite method of dealing with dissent; his fellow ogres call him bonebreaker, for his love of marrow.  But everyone calls him dangerous, and nobody calls him stupid, for unlike many of his race, he possesses a keen mind.  He wears a set of custom-made, plated armour, and though he carries no weapon, it is said that his fists carry more weight than the greatest mace or sword.
HORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hord growls and spits, revealing a mouth of broken teeth.
FILCH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Filch
FILCH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Filch
FILCH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall gnomish man, standing a full four and a half feet tall, Filch's startlingly bright eyes glitter from beneath the hood of his cloak.  Dressed simply in a dark green tunic, he wears an array of knives and small swords at his belt.  A masterful thief, it is said that he once scooped a cup from a dragon's hoard, and lived to tell the tale, though the wrath of the dragon was great, and for the nearby islanders, the story ended very poorly indeed.
FILCH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Filch grins at you. "Good day to you!"
MYRDIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Myrdin
MYRDIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Myrdin
MYRDIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A celebrated dwarven hero, Myrdin is said to have boarded a raiding ship and killed every ogre aboard.  His appearance is striking: a braided brown beard, a thick mail coat, and a shield nearly as tall as he.  In his left hand he holds a great falchion, its blade inscribed with some sort of runic writing.  It gives off a soft green glow.  Unlike many dwarves, who prefer an unadorned or horned helmet, Myrdin wears a bronze helm crested with horse-hair, reminiscent of the warriors of the vanished empires.
MYRDIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Myrdin salutes you with his falchion.
ALTEUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alteus
ALTEUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alteus
ALTEUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Champion of the giants, standing a full fifteen feet tall, Alteus looks less mortal than divine.  His face is impassive and unreadable, his legs covered with scarred bronze greaves.  Perhaps due to his tremendeous height, he wears little other armour.  In his hands, he holds a lance as long a dragon, tipped with a fearsome, leaf-shaped blade.
ALTEUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alteus laughs, a deep belly-laugh that is impossible to ignore. "Ahahaha!"
LAYAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Layal
LAYAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Layal
LAYAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A member of the central desert tribes, Layal has many nicknames.  Whirlwind, Sandstorm, White Death - these are the names given to her both by her people, and her enemies.  Dressed in a billowing shirt and pants, a scimitar tucked into her belt, she moves with incredible grace and speed.  Often seen with her horse, a white charger, she strikes quickly, cutting through her enemies and then galloping away.
LAYAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Layal growls and says something in a harsh, guttural tongue.
BAGRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bagra
BAGRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bagra
BAGRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Known in whispers as "the Black Fae", Bagra is an ancient, stooped crone.  Wearing a tattered black robe, her back severely bent, she bears the bleeding, black mark on her forehead.  One of Sceadugenga's favoured, she has been touched by him, and bears eternal corruptions.  A mass of inky blackness writhes where her tongue should be, her voice hisses and twists like a snake, and she works terrible blood magics that require the exsanguination of the innocent.  She is very old, known to old tales and poems.  She is drawn on the cover of the Black Book, an ancient tome of horrifying magic, as a stooped woman devouring a child.  To the northern tribesman, she is "Mortla", the snow that drifts on corpses.  And to her own people, she is an exile, her name never to be spoken again.
BAGRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Bagra hisses open-mouthed, and you see a churning mass of blackness within.
ALCIEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alcien
ALCIEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alcien
ALCIEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great knight of the church, the champion of Celeste, Alcien was a simple priest before receiving his greater calling.  The rector of a tiny log church nestled in the northern boreal forests, he received a vision from Celeste and began his martial path.  He has acted as pilgrim and punisher, restoring ancient holy sites, and bringing the blade to marauding monsters and horrors.  He wears a suit of the finest elven mail, and strapped to his back is a huge greatsword, a gift from his goddess in reward of his devotion.  
ALCIEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alcien draws his blade, and it erupts with holy light.
RUKHALA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rukhala
RUKHALA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rukhala
RUKHALA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When parents tell their children of Sceadugenga, and the horrors of the black god, they invoke a single name to terrify their children: Rukhala.  Black priest, highest of his kind, he acts as envoy of the eldritch horror.  He stalks the outer lands, razing entire villages as sacrifices to his dark god.  Appearing as a small, thin man, with a neatly trimmed beard and a piercing stare, he is said to dress well, have a soft, high voice, and impeccable manners.  But wherever he goes, a black wind follows.  Scented with death spices, the smell of this is a sure portent of one's coming death.
RUKHALA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=As Rukhala walks, you hear the sound of a low, heavy wind - sweet, and scented with sickly spices.
QUIVERING_BLOB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quivering blob
QUIVERING_BLOB_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quivering blob
QUIVERING_BLOB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, semi-solid gelatinous creature, quivering blobs attack with small bursts of electricity.  With this, they are able to paralyze their prey, and then envelop them.  Unlike some other jellies, which are more acidic, the process of digestion for quivering blobs is much slower.  As a result of this, one can often see creatures within the blob, slowly being eaten away by its weak digestive acids.
QUIVERING_BLOB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quivering blob wibbles at you threateningly.
GIANT_TOAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant toad
GIANT_TOAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant toad
GIANT_TOAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mottled brown and green, giant toads can grow almost as tall as a man.  While they are slow-moving, they are certainly capable of defending themselves.  Able to spit up to ten feet away, giants toads loose an acidic fluid so strong that it can eat through armour and bone.  Their diet is primarily insects and small mammals, but small piles of pitted weapons and armour have been found deep in marshes, and it has long been suspected that giant toads have had a role to play.
GIANT_TOAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant toad croaks.
GIANT_FROG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant frog
GIANT_FROG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant frog
GIANT_FROG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Slightly smaller than the giant toad, the giant frog shares its ability to spit fluids.  But while the giant toads spittle is acidic and dissolving, the giant frog's is poisonous.  Possessing a venom as powerful as a viper's, the giant frog is able to cover its victims in its poison, and patiently wait for the venom to be absorbed.  Once in the bloodstream, the poison acts quickly, killing the creature and allowing the frog to devour it slowly, at its leisure.
GIANT_FROG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant frog ribbits.
CRONE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=crone
CRONE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a crone
CRONE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tales tell of a bent and hobbled creature, a cloaked spirit that stalks the living-lands, a crone, though that name defiles the living.  Its voice is said to be that of an old woman, but its touch is from the deepest hells.  Piercing the thickest armour, it is said to inflict all manner of blights.  As a result, crones are deeply feared; thankfully, owing to their slow speed, they are also quickly outpaced.
CRONE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The crone is speechless beneath her wispy cowl.
SHAPESHIFTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shapeshifter
SHAPESHIFTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shapeshifter
SHAPESHIFTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Minor demons possessing some basic magical powers, shapeshifters walk among men and take their forms.  Though from the black plains, shapeshifters are not always malevolent; some take a liking to the places in which they live, and help out those around them.  But others are not so kind, and use their powers for evil.  Taking the form of something pleasing - a beautiful girl, a handsome young man - they use their powers to get near their victims before unleashing a sudden and savage attack.
SHAPESHIFTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shapeshifter grins at you, its mouth bursting with teeth.
KNIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=knight
KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a knight
KNIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When it comes to war, status means everything.  The majority of those called up to serve their king are simple peasant farmers, quickly made into infantry, given a basic spear or axe and little hope.  There are those who have served, or whose families have served, with distinction in the past, and these men are honoured accordingly.  Made knights, given rank and land, they enter battle with mail or plate, a sturdy shield, and a well-balanced blade.  A trained knight is no match for a band of simple spearman, able to quickly parry their clumsy attacks and tear into them with his long sword.
KNIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The knight hails you.
ROILING_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=roiling slime
ROILING_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a roiling slime
ROILING_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While it is well-known among adventurers that jellies can split when attacked, they are largely stable when under their own power.  The exception to this is the roiling slime, a strange, almost clear jelly.  It gets its name from the sediment it picks up underneath - as it moves, the sediment swirls and spirals, before being expelled.  Thought to be the creation of some unstable physical or magical process, roiling slimes are known to spontaneously split, and attack with a powerful acid, which they release in small bursts towards their prey.
ROILING_SLIME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The roiling slime quivers unsteadily.
CRUSADER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=crusader
CRUSADER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a crusader
CRUSADER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The kings of the world have their favoured warriors, their knights, who can be worth twenty or more soldiers on the battlefield.  The more organized orders of the Nine saw this, and set about creating their own divine defenders.  From this came the crusaders.  Selected early for their strength and faith, crusaders receive both martial and theological training.  More studied than a priest and more powerful than a king's knight, crusaders are admired - and feared.  Given a mandate to seek out and destroy the enemies of their order, they are armoured in warded plate, and armed with holy blades.
CRUSADER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The crusader salutes you.
NAGA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=naga
NAGA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a naga
NAGA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Serpent-demons of the black plains, nagas combine the upper body of a man or woman with the body of a snake.  They possess a great strength, using their tail to crush and constrict, able to lift and throw small boulders.  Though they have a human mouth, they are either unable to unwilling to talk, and tales have been told of nagas enduring great wounds in combat without so much as a single scream.
NAGA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The naga snarls, its tail curling menacingly.
VORPAL_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=vorpal bug
VORPAL_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a vorpal bug
VORPAL_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange creature, the vorpal bug is a very large insect, though still smaller than some of the massive insects that have been catalogued.  It has a mottled, blue-and-white carapace, a dozen legs, and crawls slowly through caves and dungeons.  What differentiates it from other insects, though, is its massive, serrated pincers.  It can move these with lightning speed, inflicting terrible damage on its prey.  Its name is not given lightly: it has been known, from time to time, to generate such force as to cleave its victims in two.
VORPAL_BUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The vorpal bug jumps and clicks.
CAVE_BEAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave bear
CAVE_BEAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave bear
CAVE_BEAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be a distant cousin of the great grizzly bears that roam the old forests, cave bears live deep within mountain caves, emerging to hunt mountain goats and other creatures.  Standing even taller than the grizzly, the cave bear can grow to a height of nine feet.  They are so strong, and their claws so tough, that they have been known to leave massive gouges in stone.  Despite their size and ferocity, they typically leave people well-alone, preferring the more docile goats, but they have been known to emerge from the mountains in hard times when food is scarce.
CAVE_BEAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave bear growls menacingly.
MANTICORE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=manticore
MANTICORE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a manticore
MANTICORE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Covered with blue-black fur, the manticore has the body of a lion, large, leathery wings, and a human head.  Its tail is covered with venomous barbs.  It is able to fling these at nearby foes, and the missing barbs regenerate almost immediately, as if by magic.  Manticores figure prominently in the myths and legends of many people, often as tricksters, though in truth, they seem to exhibit little intelligence and are more like extremely aggressive animals.
MANTICORE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The manticore roars.
SWORD_EATER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sword-eater
SWORD_EATER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sword-eater
SWORD_EATER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Powerful, semi-intelligent oozes that can be found throughout the world, sword-eaters are nearly transparent, having only the smallest traces of opacity.  Their name derives from their intense acidity; when they envelop a sword or other object, their acids are able to corrode it to the point of uselessness within several minutes.  Though this makes them dangerous to the unwary, they are slow-moving, and can typically be outpaced very easily.
ROCK_CRAWLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock crawler
ROCK_CRAWLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock crawler
ROCK_CRAWLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Deep below the earth, within the rock itself, there live massive insects capable of burrowing through the rock itself.  These mindless insects are rock crawlers, and break down the rock with a combination of strong acids and powerful mandibles.  They normally feed on other insects, rats, and other small mammals, but will also attack dwarves, gnomes, and other cavern-dwellers if the opportunity arises.
LIVING_VINES_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=living vines
LIVING_VINES_DESCRIPTION_SID=the living vines
LIVING_VINES_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living vines have long been known by the world peoples.  Appearing at first to be a tangle of vines covering a rock or tree, they quickly lash out, constricting the creature and then slowly breaking it down to absorb its nutrients.  Because of this aggressive behaviour, living vines are rarely found near any kind of civilization, as farmers and peasants will carefully destroy them on sight, lest the vines be allowed to grow unchecked.
WITCHTHORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=witchthorn
WITCHTHORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the witchthorn
WITCHTHORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings have long lived away from society, persecuted for their innate powers.  Making their houses in forests or caves, away from those who would seek to harm them, witchlings often ring their homes with witchthorn.  This ancient plant is exceptionally dense and fast-growing plant has branches as hard as wood, and hair-thin, needle-like thorns.  Many poor adventurers have succumbed to their injuries after attempting to find a safe way over, bled to death by hundreds of hidden thorns.
WITCHTHORN_THORN_FIRED=The witchthorn fires a thorn!
TREOW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=treow
TREOW_DESCRIPTION_SID=a treow
TREOW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thousands of years ago, in the deepest, darkest parts of the old forests, a powerful magic took hold.  The massive, old-growth trees uprooted and began to walk.  In a number of the old tongues, these trees were called "treow", an ancient word for tree.  The number of treow seems to have remained constant over the years, and it is thought that some magical process still animates ancient trees and grants them mobility.  Treow are unspeaking, but not unintelligent, fearsome fighters quick to exploit an opponent's weakness.  They slash and pound with their branches, and fear fire more than anything else.
PRESENCE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=presence
PRESENCE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a presence
PRESENCE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tales tell of people whose souls drop away, lifeless but living; these same tales tell of the overpowering will of a black presence, an unholy demon from the far planes.  Latching into the minds of their victims, presences control their victims in the manner of a puppetmaster, they themselves barely visible, using some strange power to bend the light around them.  Tapping into the parasite's immense strength and intellect, the inhabited bodies are granted enormous power.  Over time, though, the body becomes jerkier and jerkier - the brain, in atrophy from disuse, slowly ceases to function.  With the death of the host, the presence moves on, crawling low on the earth in search of something different.  Something new.
PRESENCE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The inhabited body says nothing, and its jaw suddenly dips and twists into a soulless smile.
TANGLEWEED_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tangleweed
TANGLEWEED_DESCRIPTION_SID=the tangleweed
TANGLEWEED_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A short, woody plant with thin, razor-sharp hairs, tangleweed grows naturally almost anywhere.  Typically growing four to five inches in height, its stem is bright green with small white spots, and its hairs are almost invisible to the naked eye.  It seems to react aggressively to disturbances, sending its hairs spinning and slashing.  Because of the thinness and sharpness of the hairs, the plant can be quite dangerous, causing heavy bleeding as the hairs become lodged in the skin.
DRAKHEEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drakheen
DRAKHEEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drakheen
DRAKHEEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=First named by the nomads of the great central deserts, the drakheen are dragon-like demons who walk upright like men.  When angered, they are known to breathe a deep, green fire.  However, the wings on their back appear useless; of the recorded reports of drakheen, none have ever mentioned flight.  Intensely intelligent, drakheen appear able to speak to any man in his native tongue, fluently and without accent.  Throughout history, there have been wizards who have attempted to summon and subsequently bind drakheen to their will, in an attempt to learn their secrets.  In each case, the history records the wizard as being enslaved, dragged down into the depths of the black plains for their hubris.
DRAKHEEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drakheen watches you intently, its expression smouldering.
WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wraith
WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wraith
WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The souls of powerful men forced to wander as spirits, wraiths are insubstantial, appearing at first glance as cloaked men.  But their cloaks are only darkness, and beneath that darkness is a pair of eyes, burning red with hate.  Powerful night-hunters, they can pass easily through wood and stone in pursuit of the living.  Unlike some undead, who show an affinity for unholy magics, wraiths do not appear to have any skill at this; instead, their touch is colder than death, drawing the souls from the living to the gates of the underworld.
WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wraith hisses, "Thin sawol is min, cild!"
SORCEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sorceror
SORCEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sorceror
SORCEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings are those able to harness the energies of the universe, the cold, shadowy magics born from the stars.  But there are those who are able to derive magical power from the world itself, and these men and women are sorcerors.  They can call upon the heavens to strike with lightning, conjure fire from the air, and summon frost and snow.  Though less hated than witchlings, sorcerors are nonetheless deeply distrusted, and many take up a wanderer's life, wending their way from town to town.  But it is said that all accidents are the work of sorcery, all bad luck, and so a sorceror's stay is never long.
SORCEROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sorceror murmurs a few words, and his staff begins to glow.
WHITEBARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Whitebard
WHITEBARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Whitebard
WHITEBARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A gifted child, the musician known as Whitebard grew up in the mountain settlements around Atua-Elar.  Focusing on music early, he started with the lyre, learning to accompany the sung poetry of the mountain elves.  Mastering that instrument, he learned the vihuela and the lute, as well as fife and drums.  He fell in love with a girl from a passing ship; their love was brief and intense, and then over.  The ship was attacked by goblin raiders, but while the gutted corpses of the sailors washed up in the harbours, the girl's body was never found.  Whitebard spent years travelling, searching, following any clue he could find.  Eventually, he descended deep beneath the earth, and found something meant to be unseen.  He was driven mad, his hair turning bright white, his only words now, "Sasha, Sasha, Sasha."
WHITEBARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Whitebard mourns, "My love, my love, I'll never find her now."
MIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mire
MIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mire
MIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing as little more than unstable ground, mires are actually a member of the jelly family.  Unlike most jellies, which attack with their acidity, mires attack with a fast-acting poison.  They often lurk deep in dungeons, appearing in damp areas as a muddy section of the floor.  Due to their lack of acidity, they do not fully consume corpses like other jellies, and so it is said that where there are bones and swords, a mire is sure to be nearby.
MIRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mire slurps and slops.
WIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wight
WIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wight
WIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among those who follow the dark arts, it has long been known that the quality of a corpse determines its quality in unlife.  Among the recently dead, ordinary peasants are raised as thrall.  But when dark magics take hold of the particularly violent and vicious, the murderous and psychotic, the result is a wight.  After death, their strength and savagery is multiplied ten-fold.  Imbued with terrible strength, they are known to tear apart their victims, and then crack the skull and bones to feast on brain and marrow.
WIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wight hisses something in a black tongue.
SPLITTING_SHRIKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=splitting shrike
SPLITTING_SHRIKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a splitting shrike
SPLITTING_SHRIKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Birds are unique among the creatures of the world in that few of them are known to possess any magic at all.  One of the only known examples is the splitting shrike, a small, vicious bird that attacks with incredible speed.  It attacks with such speed and force that, by some magic, it splits and becomes two.  Splitting shrikes live apart from other birds - they are attacked on sight by other birds, who sense their magical and threatening nature.
SPLITTING_SHRIKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The splitting shrike shrieks.
MARSH_WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=marsh wraith
MARSH_WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a marsh wraith
MARSH_WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Some ancient peoples, living near bogs and marshes, were aware of the preservation qualities of bogs and marshes.  The bog water, poor in oxygen, would naturally preserve the bodies deposited there.  One such swamp was used as the burial ground for criminals and psychopaths, and over time, the character of the dead changed the character of the land.  And with time, the dead began to rise again.  Cloaked in rags and tatters, their skin stretched and gaunt, they clutch long knives honed to a strange sharpness, and are imbued with a terrible power - the power to divide and overwhelm.  For the same magic that raised them from the waters has given them the ability to split apart.  Campfire tales tell of adventurers overwhelmed by wraiths, surrounded and ceaselessly stabbed with knives before their bodies are drowned in the marsh and raised in rebirth.
MARSH_WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The marsh wraith seethes and steams.
DROWNED_SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drowned shade
DROWNED_SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drowned shade
DROWNED_SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Geologists have long theorized that the islands were once a continent.  Parts of them fit, but not all.  Religious scholars posit that Aurelion himself split the continent with his massive hammer, breaking apart the land an unleashing terrible tidal forces.  It is thought that the spirits called drowned shades were part of some culture destroyed by this rending.  Semi-solid, covered in kelp and cockles, they nevertheless look almost human.  In their hands, they clutch long copper knives, dripping as if with salt water, made green by verdigris.
DROWNED_SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drowned shade speaks something to you, its language completely alien.
SEEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seeper
SEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seeper
SEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A greater spirit, the seeper is a creature greatly feared by those who practice magic.  Seepers are said to first form from the spirit of magicians who refuse to leave the material world.  As they travel in their unlife, their loneliness turns to rage and hate, and they draw the magical force out of those they encounter.  As they do so, the power fuses with their own, and they begin to take on the characteristics of their victims.  Their form shifts to appear like them, their voice changes in mimicry.  But as they continue to draw from the living, they are unable to hold their form for long.  Their appearance shifts and alters, sometimes slowly, sometimes abruptly, in a jumble of identities and forms.
SEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=You are greeted by a cacophony of voices.
STEEL_GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=steel golem
STEEL_GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a steel golem
STEEL_GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Golems are traditionally made of clay, the result being a behemoth of a man under the complete control of its creator.  But the use of clay is only traditional, and not required.  When shaped of precious steel, the golem created is terrifying indeed.  Standing near twice as tall as a man, steel golems creak and gleam, noisy, but nearly unstoppable.  When they strike, they do so with more force than the strongest hammer, shattering rock and stone.  
PIRRHA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pirrha
PIRRHA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pirrha
PIRRHA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thin and frail-looking, Pirra has a rather ordinary appearance.  His high cheekbones and sunken cheeks lend a gaunt expression, but his movements are quick; very quick.  Underneath the dirty cloak, several knives of varying lengths are tucked into his belt.  His eyes, a very dark brown, look to have some kind of darkness in them, an ugly, inky murk that roils as he speaks.
PIRRHA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A thin smile spread across Pirrha's face. "These bones are for the glory of our black lord. I think yours should do well, too!"
WISPE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wispe
WISPE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wispe
WISPE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, non-descript man, Wispe looks to be hovering somewhere around middle age.  His black hair is greying, his beard streaked with white, but despite these signs of age, his eyes are still piercing and unsettling.  In taverns, he is mentioned quietly, and only briefly: he seems friendly, folk say, but his travelling companions disappear; there is something chilling behind the man.  From the top of his right boot protrudes the pommel of a thin blade.
WISPE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Wispe looks at you and allows himself a very small smile.
WILL_O_THE_WISP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=will o' the wisp
WILL_O_THE_WISP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a will o' the wisp
WILL_O_THE_WISP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At night, lights can often be seen over marshes and fens, strange flickerings that come and go.  Modern scholars agree that most of these are related to the eruption of certain gases present in the swamp.  However, this explanation does not satisfy the claims of some survivors of being followed and attacked by strange lights, not just in marshes, but in fields, forests, and even caves.  Most agree that the latter are released spirits of the dead, souls that attack the living with burts of magic and light.  Also known as "faerie lights", will o' the wisps are exceedingly weak and nimble.  It is said that a couple of sword-thrusts are sufficient to extinguish them, though actually landing a blow can be problematic.
WERELIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=were-light
WERELIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a were-light
WERELIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing first to the eye as distant torch-light, were-light is in fact something far older.  At some point in the distant past, ancient beings descended from the stars to the earth.  And so strong was their will that when their mortal bodies passed, their spirits condensed into blazing balls of light.  Changing in colour, they flicker from orange to green, blue to white, crackling with intense, electro-telluric power.
GRAVE_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=grave worm
GRAVE_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a grave worm
GRAVE_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the ecosystem of decomposers, scholars have produced a great list of small, seemingly insignificant creatures that break down living matter.  But there is another creature, much larger, that performs this task, and this is the massive grave worm.  A long, green worm reaching the length of a man's leg, this worm breaks down plant and animal matter quickly with its powerful acids.  It lives deep underground, and is most typically found as an unpleasant surprise when exhuming the recently dead, writhing through flesh and bone.
BLACK_SERVANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black servant
BLACK_SERVANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black servant
BLACK_SERVANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers of Sceadugenga are ostracized at best; often, they are killed outright, for fear of the horrifying powers sought.  But all bear a distinctive mark: a dull black mark on the forehead, that slowly bleeds from the edges.  Black servants are granted the black corruption, allowing them to petrify the living things that they touch.  These powers, and the psychosis that accompanies them, force black servants to the fringes of society.  Walking the woods and forests, they live in caves and caverns, spreading their corruption and hoping to learn more of the black secrets of the universe.
BLACK_SERVANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black servant hisses a response, its words ugly and seething.
CARAVAN_MASTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=caravan master
CARAVAN_MASTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the caravan master
CARAVAN_MASTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A handsome man, regal and impossibly old, the caravan master is one of the few fae remaining who walks the world.  Dressed in fine silks of green, blue, and brown, his movements are quick and assured, his eyes piercing.  He has led his caravan for countless untold years since the fae began to vanish, moving from place to place, never staying long.  He carries all his possessions in a small caravan, a rickety covered wagon whose white paint has started to chip and peel.  It seems to be bursting with all manner of items.  Strange-looking swords and paintings share space with clothing and fine furs, and the smell of exotic spices fill the air.
CARAVAN_MASTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The caravan master laughs, his laughter echoing like music around you.
CARAVAN_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=caravan guard
CARAVAN_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a caravan guard
CARAVAN_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fae, being so few and foreign, are often distrusted.  When they brush up against civilization, they often find themselves receiving a chilly welcome - or worse.  Because of this, some of their number serve as guardsmen.  Clad in armour and wielding elemental magics, these guardsmen are well-trained, experienced, and capable of unleashing great destruction of the enemies of their caravans.
CARAVAN_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The caravan guard eyes you warily.
FAE_MUSICIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fae musician
FAE_MUSICIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fae musician
FAE_MUSICIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fae, few that they are, are known to be great musicians.  All can play or sing something, and in the eternally-long lives of the fae, those that choose to devote their lives to music become very good indeed.  Practiced in all forms of music, fae musicians can sing and drum, play flutes, viols, and trumpets.  For many, their favourite instrument is a small, lute-like instrument called the "cith", which produces sweet, soft music that other musicians find incapable of duplication.
FAE_MUSICIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fae musician sings, "O cruel were his parents who sent my love to sea, and cruel was the ship that bore my love from me..."
FAE_TRAVELLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fae traveller
FAE_TRAVELLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fae traveller
FAE_TRAVELLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most fae are wanderers, travelling the wilderness in their pony-drawn caravans, staying for a season in ancient moorlands or forests before moving on.  Fae travellers typically do not carry weapons, but are certainly prepared for hostilities.  Having some knowledge of magic, they can attack with elemental forces, preferring to attack with frost and cold to slow their enemies, allowing an escape if necessary.  They prefer light, loose clothes, which always appear to be in immaculate condition - whether this is the case, or some sort of glamour, is uncertain.
FAE_TRAVELLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fae traveller hails you.
BLACK_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black priest
BLACK_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black priest
BLACK_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Nine each bless their priests for their devotion and loyalty.  Normally, they grant wisdom, strength, or constitution; but Sceadugenga, the black horror, goes far beyond that.  His priests are granted insight and wisdom, but at a terrifying cost.  Their bodies become sickly and frail; their touch becomes death, inflicting the grey sickness; and their faces, beneath the heavy cowl of their robes, becomes insubstantial, a writhing mass of darkness punctuated by two hateful, burning eyes.
BLACK_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black priest fixes you with burning eyes, its face a mass of darkness beneath the cowl.
ANTLION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=antlion
ANTLION_DESCRIPTION_SID=an antlion
ANTLION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An enormous beast with the torso and tail of a lion and the head and limbs of a massive ant, the antlion is a terrifying predator.  It arrives seemingly out of nowhere, burrowing out of the ground.  Despite its huge size, it is relatively silent, emitting only a faint, chittering sound.  It attacks with its mandibles, stabbing and tearing, killing its prey before dragging it down beneath the earth.
ANTLION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The antlion chitters.
CAVE_TROLL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave troll
CAVE_TROLL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave troll
CAVE_TROLL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Larger and much more stupid than their surface-dwelling counterparts (who themselves sometimes inhabit caves), cave trolls grow to the size of giants, but are typically hunched over, due to the caverns they inhabit.  Those that live in the larger caves, though, do not have this hunch, and are imposing figures indeed.  Their skin is a rough grey, and they tend to wear the skins of whatever they can find - goat, bear, even dwarf.  They wield massive stalactites as clubs, able to destroy organs and shatter bone through even the strongest armour.
CAVE_TROLL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave troll growls and stares at you through squinted eyes.
COCKATRICE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cockatrice
COCKATRICE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cockatrice
COCKATRICE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange, awkward little beast, the cockatrice is the magical fusion of a dragon and a rooster.  Barely larger than a rooster itself, its body and head are that of the bird, with its wings and stubby, scaly tail being that of the dragon.  But the cockatrice, unlike the dragon, does not deal in fire and heat: instead, its bite is renowned for being intensely corrupting, injecting its victims with a fast-acting toxin.  The toxin stiffens and petrifies.  Working quickly, it kills from within, leaving the victim as hard and calcified as a statue.  More than one statue has been found of a mighty warrior, sword raised overhead, ready to deal a killing blow.
COCKATRICE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cockatrice stomps and crows.
STONE_OOZE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone ooze
STONE_OOZE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone ooze
STONE_OOZE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Deep in the darkest caverns and forests, a strange creature slithers.  The stone ooze is a magical jelly; slow, but deadly.  It has a powerful acid that can cause petrification.  The stone ooze uses this acid to great effect, petrifying its prey, and then slowly enveloping it.  Once it has completely surrounded the petrified corpse, it dissolves it, slowly, over a period of weeks.
FOX_MAIDEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox maiden
FOX_MAIDEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox maiden
FOX_MAIDEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is said that when foxes reach a certain age, they can take on human form.  Being tricksters, these fox-spirits often take the form of a beautiful, naked woman.  These fox maidens travel the world, captivating men and holding them spellbound.  Once the victim is fully captivated, the fox maiden attacks, savagely devouring the heart and brain while the victim still breathes.
FOX_MAIDEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox maiden smiles at you, her naked form captivating.
FIREBIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=firebird
FIREBIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a firebird
FIREBIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature of myth and legend, the firebird is a great bird born of flame and ash.  It is said that the firebird is eternal, and cannot be killed - each time that it is, it dies in a burst of flame, and then is immediately reborn.  It is a massive creature, larger even than the roc, with a wingspan of nearly a hundred feet.  Its feathers are red-yellow, and when the firebird takes flight, its feathers waver and ripple like an inferno.
FIREBIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The firebird shrieks.
DIRE_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dire wolf
DIRE_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dire wolf
DIRE_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The dire wolf is the largest of the canine species, larger than the great cats, and with only a little exaggeration, almost as large as a mammoth.  Dire wolves have a thick, silvery coat that allows them to blend in easily in arctic environments.  In fact, this is where they are most often found.  Their size and terrifying appearance has made them all but extinct in more populated areas; though the stray dire wolf can be found around civilization, they are most commonly found on the uninhabited outlying islands.  Dire wolves are popular, with lions, griffins, and the like, as symbols of royal houses, being featured on many coats of arms throughout history.
DIRE_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dire wolf growls, its entire body quivering and shaking.
LYCAON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lycaon
LYCAON_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lycaon
LYCAON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wretched creature that used to be a man, Lycaon was transformed into a great wolf as punishment for his doubt and blasphemy.  It is said that Celeste took human form and walked across the earth, and that Lycaon, seeing others worship the goddess, jeered them and secretly planned to show her as human.  His plan was to murder her at night; but not content with this, he decided to serve her an ill supper as well.  Taking a hostage captured from combat, he led him into the woods, then cut his throat, and prepared a feast of the remains.  As he set the meal in front of her, Celeste transformed him into a wretched beast, forcing him to live his days wandering the earth as a hunted, hateful wolf.
LYCAON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lycaon howls in anguish.
CHAOS_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chaos beast
CHAOS_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chaos beast
CHAOS_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Little is known about the chaos beast because it changes so quickly that two scholars are rarely sure if they are discussing the same creature.  Its basic form is thought to be a huge beast, similar in size to a rhinoceros, covered in a dense, shaggy fur.  But due to some chaotic magic, this is rarely true for long: it adds and removes heads, appears as a small dragon, shifts into a griffin, and then changes again.  The chaos beast is savage, attacking ferociously regardless of size or number.  Usually in myth they are described as living deep in mountains, coming from the caves to lay waste to the world.
CHAOS_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chaos beast shimmers briefly.
GHAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghast
GHAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghast
GHAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Slow walkers to some, black wraiths to others, ghasts are undead but perfectly preserved.  They resemble their living forms exactly in all ways but one: their eyes are startling and green.  They wear the rags of their former selves, wretched tunics and bits of cloaks, which they clutch about them with deathly grasps.  It is said that ghasts walk slowly but move quickly.  They are slow to approach, but their reflexes are keen and precise, and their touch is greatly feared.  It can turn a man to stone, or slow him; it can paralyze him, or poison him.  And it is said that those killed by a ghast are doomed to take this form themselves, forced to walk for eternity in the dungeons and ruins of the world.
GHAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghast hisses, its mouth unmoving, fouling the wretched air.
ICHOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ichor
ICHOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ichor
ICHOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ranging in shade from yellow to brown, ichors are a thin form of jelly found deep in dungeons and caverns.  They flow like small rivers, slowly dissolving rock with their potent acid, working their way deeper into the earth.  While unintelligent, they seem aware of creatures around them, and will divert their movement to attempt to dissolve any living thing nearby.
ICHOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ichor burbles and blups.
FELL_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fell lord
FELL_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fell lord
FELL_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Each of the Nine has their favoured servants, and for Urgoth, these are the fell lords.  It is said that these are created from the spirits of lords who worship the Black Ogre, given eternal life in exchange for celestial servitude.  These shimmering creatures appear as massive men the size of ogres.  Fell Lords wear a lord's clothing and gold, and carry a massive, flaming sword.  They speak softly in a strange, astral language, whispering a few words before attacking with a savage fury.
FELL_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fell lord whispers something you cannot understand.
RED_LADY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=red lady
RED_LADY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a red lady
RED_LADY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Legends throughout the world tell of the Red Lady, a bloody woman in a red dress.  It is said that, after learning of an infidelity, the woman is overwhelmed and murders her husband, children, and then herself.  But such an affront to the Nine binds the soul to the earth.  The lady's spirit is forced to wander; and still filled with the same hateful rage as in her final moments, viciously attacks the unwary, her ghostly form still oozing and gushing impossible amounts of blood.  Her touch is ice and death, and she tears and rips with her jagged, uneven fingernails.
RED_LADY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Red Lady wails piteously, a shrill and piercing lament.
VOIDLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=voidling
VOIDLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a voidling
VOIDLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Beyond the world's edges, in space, there lurk creatures and horrors.  The voidlings are servants of Shiver.  They have no discernable physical appearance; rather, they appear as disturbances.  Light bends and twists around them, causing them to look like warps in reality.  They are accompanied by an intense, unearthly cold.  A voidling's touch drains heat, leaving only frozen husks behind.
VOIDLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The voidling reaches towards you, and you feel a sudden cold.
WITCH_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=witch king
WITCH_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a witch king
WITCH_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings work with the very magic the world is made of, and the most skilled are called witch kings.  These spellcasters are tremendously powerful, wielding the force of shadows to their ends, whether good or evil.  Prolonged exposure to this magic alters them, though; a witch king can always be identified by their eyes, black and unblinking.
WITCH_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The witch king stares at you through inky-black eyes.
BLACK_MONK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black monk
BLACK_MONK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black monk
BLACK_MONK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most of the religious orders preach poverty and service.  The monks of Celeste, Vedere, and others will often take a break from life at the monastery to walk the roads and trails, begging for food, and helping those they can.  But the monks of Sceadugenga have a different purpose: they wander the roads and fields, murdering those they meet.  These monks are granted great strength for their devotion, as strong as the greatest knight or soldier.  As such, they need little other than their hands to dispatch travellers.  Thankfully, they can be easily identified.  Black monks always wear a distinctive, light grey robe with a strange black sigil upon the front and back.
BLACK_MONK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black monk tenses as you speak.
BLACK_SUMMONER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black summoner
BLACK_SUMMONER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black summoner
BLACK_SUMMONER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black-cloaked, aged, the summoners of Cithriel are wizards from the central lands who have turned to the dark embrace of Sceadugenga.  Bearing the black, bleeding mark, they found in their ancient texts a reference to the ward used by the faerie folk to hide the entrance to Cithriel, their underground hall.  Bending the seal, they were able to enter, and found a place of greatly concentrated magic, a place where planes collide and where demons and horrors can be summoned and bound.  The summoners are bent double by their age, and walk by aid of their staves, but command a fearsome power, not nearly as frail as they seem.
BLACK_SUMMONER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black summoner hisses, "the living are naught but sacrifices to our lord Sceadugenga!"
VIREQUUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=virequus
VIREQUUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a virequus
VIREQUUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The minotaur is half-bull, half man; the virequus is literally the "man-horse".  A virequus stands taller than the minotaur, and is even more fearsome.  Its legs end in a horse's hooves, though it has human hands at the ends of its arms.  And, instead of a human head, it has a massive horse's head, full of rage and fury.  Virequus typically wield huge, spiked clubs, and have sometimes served as tomb guardians to ancient kings.
VIREQUUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The virequus snorts and stamps its feet.
GOLDEN_EAGLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golden eagle
GOLDEN_EAGLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a golden eagle
GOLDEN_EAGLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A huge and semi-mythical bird, the golden eagle is known as such for the distinctive, dark-gold colouring of the tips of the feathers.  Golden eagles perch atop mountains, watching the world below.  They swoop down to grab bears, caribou, and other huge mammals, feasting on them at the top of the world.  In the past, some sorcerors were known to talk to the eagles and be permitted to ride, but there have been no records of this succeeding in more than a thousand years; all known attempts have ended in quick and bloody failure.
GOLDEN_EAGLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The golden eagle shrieks.
GORGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gorgon
GORGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gorgon
GORGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The gorgon is a female monster, roughly human in appearance, save for the hair, in place of which is a writhing mass of poisonous snakes - asps, vipers, mambas.  Often pictured in a simple white dress, the gorgon has figured prominently in mythology.  Many heroes have been tasked with slaying one, almost all unsuccessfully.  For it is said that, in addition to the venom of a hundred snake-bites, gorgons possess one other terrifying quality: that of petrification.  Some say it is their gaze that causes it, or their touch.  But the many statues of champions frozen in time suggest that it is no rumour, and very real indeed.
GORGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gorgon whispers sweet words, trying to lure you in.
STAR_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=star beast
STAR_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a star beast
STAR_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A race of creatures inhabiting the heavens, some say that star beasts live within the stars themselves.  Others say that star beasts are actually the expulsions of stars, sent during solar eruptions to punish the wicked.  On earth, solar beasts appear strange and terrifying: a constantly shifting form, almost semi-liquid, surrounded by a halo of intense, visible heat.  They fly through the air with ease, and anything in its way becomes little more than cinders and ash.
STAR_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The star beast burns with an unearthly fire, unspeaking.
KING_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=king slime
KING_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a king slime
KING_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is unknown just what causes king slimes to form - whether they naturally grow to their size, or they are the amalgamation of many smaller slimes.  They tend to live in moist areas, feeding by dissolving their prey with powerful acid and feasting on the nutrients.  Because of their size, they are easily spotted, and hunted ruthlessly.  As a result, they are often found far from civilization, feeding on mammals, birds, and insects.
KING_SLIME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The king slime wobbles threateningly.
WAR_MAMMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=war mammoth
WAR_MAMMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a war mammoth
WAR_MAMMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mammoths are dangerous enough on their own, having a thick hide, sharp tusks, and a quick temper.  But some cultures have managed to train mammoths, and some use them as a terrifying weapon of war.  Sporting massive metal plates and spikes, these war mammoths cut swaths through enemy soldiers.  Often, riders will be perched in a small, armoured box atop the mammoth's back, guiding the beast through quick, decisive motions.  But some have been trained to attack without a rider, following signals issued by a commander nearby.  These are often used as siege-breakers, single-mindedly attacking gates and walls, and ignoring the stones, arrows, and pitch.
WAR_MAMMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The war mammoth bellows.
BLACK_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black devil
BLACK_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black devil
BLACK_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Out of the depths of hell come the black devils.  Fire-breathing, dog-headed demons covered in blood and gore, they command companies of demons in the struggle of the factions of the black plains.  The black devils are savage and cunning.  Those who would tempt fate by attempting bargaining with them often find themselves dragged down into hell, forced to serve in the hellish hordes until their lives are extinguished.
BLACK_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black devil talks to you in a low voice, its demonic words impossible to decipher.
SCREAMER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=screamer
SCREAMER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a screamer
SCREAMER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Terrifying, quick spirits, screamers appear formless but briefly flash hateful expressions that some say resemble them in life.  They are described in a nursery rhyme: "Bali was a hateful man, Bali loved to lie.  Screamers came to take poor Bali's spirit when he died."  Nobody is sure what causes these spirits to remain on the earth, shrieking and wailing, but it is popularly assumed that the spirits cannot leave until the thing to which they are bound - a person, an object - has passed as well.
SCREAMER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The screamer emits a terrible shriek.
QUADRIGA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quadriga
QUADRIGA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quadriga
QUADRIGA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The cavalry of the black plains, the quadriga is a huge chariot borne by four demonic, black horses, driven by some kind of unseen force.  Larger even than draft horses, the black horses snort and spit with a hateful intensity.  They are lashed to the yoke and chariot by ropes of magical flame.  It is said that the appearance of a quadriga, while terrifying in and of itself, is a forerunner of something truly terrible indeed.
QUADRIGA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demonic horses rear up as one.
HELLHOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hellhound
HELLHOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hellhound
HELLHOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The guards of hell, hellhounds are enormous, multi-headed dogs.  Their fur is matted, ranging from light grey to coal-black, and from their mouth erupts great gusts of flame.  These demon-hounds are not intelligent, but possess a low cunning, and are very aggressive.  These hounds prowl the perimeter of the black plains, attacking any found in the outer lands, which are said to be the domain of these hellish dogs.
HELLHOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hellhound growls, spitting fire and flame.
KINGSPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kingspirit
KINGSPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kingspirit
KINGSPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many of the rulers of the ancient world, their names now lost to time, would be buried with lustrous objects, mail-coats and broadswords, often guarded by their favoured servants, themselves buried alive.  But one people, their name unrecorded or forgotten, sent their kings and queens to sea in great flaming ships.  These triremes were bound with fantastic magics, splitting the spirit of the dead in two.  The first half was sent to the Elysian fields of the next life, to dwell in beauty for eternity.  But the second half was bound to the present world, to act as a protector and guide.  But the people faded; their magic frayed, and pulled apart.  And as it did, the kingspirits became wild and chaotic.  Unable to leave the present world, they drift, probing at the fabric of reality, hoping to find a way to join their other half in the world beyond worlds.
KINGSPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kingspirit watches you with its dead eyes, and draws a spectral blade.
SKYWING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skywing
SKYWING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skywing
SKYWING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The greatest beasts of the skies, skywings are distant kin of the dragons: larger, older, equally deadly.  Known as "black wraiths" to many, their wingspan is so great that it seems to dim the light, despite the enormous heights at which they fly.  Unable to breathe fire like their dragon-kin, they compensate with rows of bony, claw-like protrusions from their wings.  Emerging from great caverns to hunt at night, they are not picky about their diet, favouring anything large and living.  Their image is common on royal crests, and it is said that, like the dragons, they were once tamed by the greatest of men.
SKYWING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skywing flaps its wings once in response, releasing a gale-force wind.
PIT_FIEND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pit fiend
PIT_FIEND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pit fiend
PIT_FIEND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The pit fiend is said to live near the world's center, its movements the cause of earthquakes and tsunamis.  Its appearance is horrifying: the head of a massive insect, with thousands of eyes; the body of a great bear; the talons of a great raptor.  There is a known shard of ancient pottery, a large section of an amphora, that shows the destruction of Aras.  It is known that an earthquake destroyed the seaside town thousands of years ago; but recently, this shard of pottery was discovered a few hundred miles from the original site, buried in ancient mud.  It shows houses broken by earthquake, and a scene of carnage - and at its center, the horrifying pit fiend.
PIT_FIEND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pit fiend shrieks, a sound that splits the world.
ABYSSAL_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=abyssal beast
ABYSSAL_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=an abyssal beast
ABYSSAL_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The outlying tribes talk with fear of a marsh-stepper, a shadow-walker, a creature that stands as tall as three men and devastates their halls at night, stealing men and women alike.  These creatures are said to rise from caves in the marshes, descendents of ogre-kind, but something more primordial, something far older than that.  They are covered in scraggy, red-black hair; underneath, their hide is almost as thick as dragonscale.  Their fangs are thick and sharp, suitable for tearing apart flesh, and their fingers end in terrible, hooked claws.  Those that have seen these creatures talk of seeing a massive shadow, dripping muck and mire, plucking men from their beds to carry them down to their deaths in the depths of the green waters.
ABYSSAL_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The abyssal 
HIGH_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=high wizard
HIGH_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a high wizard
HIGH_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the central lands, young boys and girls study the ancient teachings of magic.  After an apprenticeship period, if they are deemed worthy, they are granted their staff and cloak-clasp, each an unmistakable sign that they are now wizards.  Most then travel, taking their talents from town to town, where the local wizard is a combination in status of elder and sage.  But some choose not to travel, and stay at the great schools instead.  They spend their days teaching, cleaning, and doing other tasks, their evenings devoted to devouring the ancient texts of the great libraries.  The greatest of these are the high wizards, men and women who learn the deep secrets of ancient magics: how to transmute common materials, unleash elemental storms, and form protective wards.  The high wizards are guardians of the physical world, capable of fighting the incursions of demons and monsters, and the horrors of the celestial beyond.
HIGH_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The high wizard whispers a greeting to you, his voice brittle as old paper.
BARROW_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=barrow wyrm
BARROW_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a barrow wyrm
BARROW_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In days gone by, the histories make mention of the death of great kings.  Buried in full raiment, surrounded by gold and swords, their deaths were great celebrations, both of the life of the deceased, and of the king or queen to come.  But precious things call like a siren to dragonkind.  To some of these great tombs came great wyrms: barrow wyrms, strong enough to scatter a king's army before slithering back to hide beneath coins, cups, and mail.  Monstrous creatures, their scales a dull, inky green, barrow wyrms remain coiled beneath the crushing weight of their hoards, always poised, always alert.  Scholars believe barrow wyrms to be the most greedy of their kind, the greatest lovers of treasure, the most fond of gold.
BARROW_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The barrow wyrm shrieks and roars, and the earth trembles.
VIGARION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vigarion
VIGARION_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vigarion
VIGARION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the great heroes of faerie time, Vigarion accepted the exchange of eternal life for eternal service.  When the prison Eka was created, he grimly agreed that he would watch over the entrance for intruders, guarding it so that none might release the hellish denizens within.  Though his actual age is now unknowable, Vigarion appears to be just shy of middle age.  He wears armour that appears to be woven of threads of steel, giving it a shimmer that reflects in the light.  Strapped to his waist is a faerie sword, lightly curved, and he wears a round shield strapped to his back.
VIGARION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Vigarion hails you with his curved faerie sword.
DRACOSPAWN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dracospawn
DRACOSPAWN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dracospawn
DRACOSPAWN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=From the ancient marshes and fens come the dracospawns, ancient creatures of the same family as dragons.  They lack the legs and wings of the dragon, having a wyrm's huge, snakelike body.  But unlike the wyrm, which has a single head, the dracospawn have many, at least half a dozen.  And while the wyrms possess a deep intelligent equal or better than humans and elves, the dracospawns are animal-like, lacking speech or the capability for deep thought.  They are, however, exceptionally dangerous, deeply aggressive and aware of their elevated position in nature.  Each head can spit a powerful acid, and with each one working together, there is little in the world that can stand in their way.
DRACOSPAWN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dracospawn's many heads shriek, producing a terrible dissonance.
SKYBORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skyborn
SKYBORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skyborn
SKYBORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the highest clouds, just before the heavens, live the strange creatures known as the skyborn.  They have a form of sorts, but it is almost as a kind of vapour.  Each of the Nine trust them as their messengers, for the skyborn are neither good nor evil.  Tales tell of crashing clouds, shrieking from the heavens, to talk in strange, high tones to the favoured; and others tell, too, of a terrifying fury unleashed against those who have chosen to stray.
SKYBORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skyborn shrieks and dives.
WEYG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Weyg
WEYG_DESCRIPTION_SID=Weyg
WEYG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of four brothers who journeyed to the underworld, Weyg is the unspoken leader of the four.  Tall, even by Giant standards, he wears a breastplate and winged helm, hefting a massive spear in one arm.  He moves deliberately and dangerously.  He wears sandals, and simple leg wrappings, with no protection below the waist.  His legs are bare and terribly scarred, bearing the wounds of untold battles.
WEYG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Weyg says something in a language lost to this world.
RHONE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rhone
RHONE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rhone
RHONE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When four brothers journeyed to the underworld to learn the secrets required to quell the Fair Folk, they were granted great strength and skill, though at a terrible cost.  Bound to walk the earth forever, they determined to guard the entranceway from anyone who would seek the bargain they took.  Rhone is the youngest of these brothers, slight, a runt by giant standards at barely eight feet tall.  But though small, he is quick, and as skilled with the bow as any elven marksman.  He holds a massive ash bow, his quiver full of arrows made from the scraggy trees that surround the lake, each shaft feathered by the green-grey feathers of some long-extinct bird.
RHONE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Rhone regards you coolly.
PHOLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Phole
PHOLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Phole
PHOLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Second in age, first in mind, Phole could be said to be the catalyst behind Elfenwael: having discovered mention of a gateway to the underworld in oral histories, he worked tirelessly to finally pinpoint its whereabouts.  In the depths of the underworld, he was granted a devil's bargain, given ancient and powerful magics in exchange for a promise to be bound forever to the upper world, to walk endlessly and watch the ages pass.  But with his brothers, he decided to guard the entrance, using his terrible magics against any unwary adventurers who sail to the far corner of the world.
PHOLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Phole speaks a few unintelligible words.
CARNE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carne
CARNE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carne
CARNE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Said to have the strength of two dragons, Carne stands almost as tall as one.  Well over thirty feet high, he wears plates of iron and steel several inches thick.  He carries an enormous, long-hafted hammer fashioned from an oak trunk and a rectangular boulder.  His face is misshapen, the result of so many crushing blows: a bent nose, a mass of scars, a burnt and mangled ear.  He does not speak, his tongue lost long ago for unknowable reasons; instead, he communicates via gestures, bleats, and hollers.
CARNE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Carne hollers mutely, his armour straining from the force of his rage.
AVERNAL_BAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=avernal bat
AVERNAL_BAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=an avernal bat
AVERNAL_BAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive creatures with a wingspan reaching thirty feet wide, avernal bats are found only around the strange lake in the dwarf-lands known as the Caldera.  Their fur is an odd blue-grey colour, and their eyes, it is said, are a bright and gleaming shade of red.  In ancient legend, the Caldera is said to be the path to the underworld, and avernal bats are widely seen as a warning to keep the living from straying into the world below.
AVERNAL_BAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The avernal bat shrieks.
MIST_WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mist wraith
MIST_WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mist wraith
MIST_WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the north-west part of the world lies an ancient lake, known as the Caldera.  Believed to be the mouth of the underworld, the Caldera is surrounded by a roiling, freezing mist.  Within this mist, there are shapes - vaguely human forms, cowled in tatters and rags, their voices whispering, calling.  These wraiths are heralds of the world beyond.  Stalking the lakelands, they look for travellers, for the heroic and foolish, and seek to hasten their journey to the second world.
MIST_WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mist wraith hisses from beneath its cowl.
WINDWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=windwalker
WINDWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a windwalker
WINDWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Given their name by the skraelings, who talk of them in hushed tones around late-night fires, the windwalkers are divine beings who stalk the cosmos, pausing occasionally to haunt and howl at the world.  Taking the form of shimmering, visible air, they appear as legless but otherwise roughly humanoid, with a pair of long, thin arms, and a contorted, screaming face.  Floating a few inches off the ground, they move quickly, surrounding their victims with a sudden, deadly cold.
WINDWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The windwalker's airy face contorts into a howl of unimaginable rage.
GOLGOTHAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golgothan
GOLGOTHAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the golgothan
GOLGOTHAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=So named for their habitat on the massive Mount Golgoth, the Golgothans are terrifying monsters somewhere between man and bird.  Like the harpy, to whom they are conceptually similar, they have the wings of a great bird.  But their wingspan is comparable to that of the mythical Roc, and their bodies are more ogre than human.  Their faces are squat, ugly, and cruel, and they care little for the cares and suffering of men.  Massive and muscled, they fly from their peaks carrying great boulders in their arms, which they use to pulverize those who stand in their way.
GOLGOTHAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=
TARASQUE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tarasque
TARASQUE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tarasque
TARASQUE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Looking like something out of myth or legend, the tarasque is a strange combination of many fierce creatures.  It most closely resembles a dragon, being reptilian, but also has the shell of a giant tortoise, a tail that ends like a scorpion's, and a head that looks almost more human than reptilian.  Tarasques are intelligent; able to converse with men, they often surprise those who have come to hunt them, offering conversation before savagely attacking.  Their principal attack is a powerful poison, a paralytic delivered by the stinger at the tip of their tail.  Despite the inherent danger in these creatures, their shells are extremely valuable.  Harder than diamond, the shells are sometimes worked using magic to create the most beautiful and protective armours in the world.
TARASQUE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tarasque smiles at you, and returns the greeting.
ANCIENT_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient worm
ANCIENT_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ancient worm
ANCIENT_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be the progenitor of dragons and wyrms, the ancient worm is a living fossil, a creature from the very earliest days of the earth.  They measure thirty to forty feet in length, moving slowly and purposefully as they burrow through soil and stone alike.  Their massive jaws, with rows of teeth-like projections, contains a powerful acid, which the worm uses to break down everything it consumes.  And unlike its modern cousins, the soft, tiny insects found in clumps of dirt, ancient worms have a scaly body thicker than plate armour or dragon scale.  They are many-segmented, and for reasons that have never been known, will spontaneously split, regrowing almost immediately.  When combined with their mindlessness, which has them attack any nearby creature, the effect is certain death and dissolution.
ANCIENT_WORM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient worm rears up.
TARO_WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Taro wraith
TARO_WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a Taro wraith
TARO_WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many mythologies describe a path of the dead that leads to underworld - a black river, a whirlpool, a wretched pit.  One of the ancient empires, now passed from memory, described the path as "Taro", the road of the dead; on this road, the walking dead cast aside their bones, with their spirits passing to the world beyond.  But some of these spirits refuse to pass, and instead, turn back.  Powerful enough to escape the maw of death and travel back to the realm of the living, they nonetheless cannot cheat the Nine and return to life.  These Taro wraiths are deeply feared - their touch brings stumbling, confusion, and eventual petrification.  Legends tell of the great wyrm of Amar, who in her hubris challenged a Taro wraith.  Travellers found the wyrm petrified outside the entrance to her lair, and this great stone sentinel took hundreds of years to crumble under the elements and return to the earth.
TARO_WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Taro wraith responds to your hail, its voice ragged and thin.
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=clockwork monstrosity
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a clockwork monstrosity
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Created by some mad artificer, clockwork monstrosities are mentioned in ancient texts only in passing, as examples of myth and fancy.  Awkward, two-legged things that walk like a slow, flightless bird, they have two massive protusions that resemble battering rams.  Only, when these are slammed forward, it is as if there are a hundred men behind the force of the blow.  Clockwork monstrosities are made of unrusting iron a full foot thick, their rams tipped in diamond so as to break through even the hardest stone.
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The clockwork monstrosity clicks and whirrs.
TIAMAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tiamat
TIAMAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tiamat
TIAMAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the great, ancient beasts, the tiamat is a fearsome creature, equally at ease in land, air, or water.  Possessing functional, dragon-like wings, and a reptilian head, it superficially resembles dragon-kin.  But besides this, the creatures are nothing alike, the tiamats far more ancient, and unrelated to the dragons.  Its scales closely resemble that of a fish.  The toes of a tiamat are webbed, and rows of gills line its neck.  These allow the tiamat to easily live underwater, which in fact they often do, occupying underwater caves and caverns.  But they can also breathe air, and some have been found making their homes deep in mountain ranges.  Tiamats, like dragons, have a terrifying breath weapon: unlike dragons, who spew fire and flame, the tiamats are able to unleash a horrifying cold, instantly freezing those who would dare come near.
TIAMAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tiamat fixes its gaze on you.
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient guardian
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ancient guardian
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Constructs more terrifying than the tallest golem, the guardians are shambling, six-armed creatures made of clay, rocks, feathers, glass - seemingly anything at hand.  Molded into a vaguely humanoid shape, they lack any facial features or expressions, their heads a jumbled assortment of materials, whimsically formed.  But imbued with magical existence, they exist for a singular purpose, guard a particular thing, and will stop at nothing should their domain be threatened.
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient guardian's faceless stare seems fixed on you.
WUMPUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wumpus
WUMPUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wumpus
WUMPUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Not much is known about the legendary wumpus.  Many adventurers have set off to hunt it (often with laughably few arrows), and none have returned.  It is assumed to be a great, yeti-like creature, but this is merely speculation, as it eats anything foolish enough to approach.
WUMPUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wumpus licks its chops.
FAIRY_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fairy spirit
FAIRY_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fairy spirit
FAIRY_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fair folk of pre-history are long gone, and their descendents, the fae, are just an echo of the great people that came before.  But traces of that great race remain - most notably in an ancient elvish epic, but also in the strange spirits that have been known to haunt freshwater springs.  These spirits appear as hazy, beautiful girls, dressed in white, flowing dresses, their hands covering their throats.  They say nothing, but desperate adventurers have told of stumbling into the springs, bloodied and exhausted, and hearing the spirits speak gently within their minds, soothing them to sleep; then later waking, fully refreshed, alone but for the sounds of the wind and birds.
FAIRY_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fairy spirit looks at you with wonder.
FAIRY_SPIRIT_HEAL_SID=The fairy spirit smiles, and slowly melds with you.  You fall into a deep slumber.
FAIRY_SPIRIT_HEAL2_SID=When you wake, you feel fully rejuvenated.
VENDOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=vendor
VENDOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a vendor
VENDOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Throughout the world, wherever there is a public gathering of people, there are entrepeneurs who realize that people have to eat.  Vendors tend to sell cheap foods for an ivory or two, making their wages on high volumes of sales.  What they actually sell tends to vary based on where they live, but some sort of cheap, skewered meat is always popular.
VENDOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The vendor smiles at you.
VENDOR_ACTION_OFFER_FOOD=The vendor says, "Food for an ivory?"
VENDOR_ACTION_PROVIDE_MEAL=The vendor tosses you a small package.
VENDOR_ACTION_SAY_GOODBYE="Next time, maybe!"
VENDOR_NO_MONEY=The vendor says, "My food costs an ivory."
PELAGEUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pelageus
PELAGEUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pelageus
PELAGEUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the great Dragon Lords, Pelageus ruled over the northern peaks with sheer terror, controlling men and dragons alike.  With his great magics and cunning, he managed to control the greatest of the wyrms, Amaurosis, the black-minded.  With the burial of the lords and their wyrms, the mortal Dragon Lords starved to death.  And as the Dragon Lords starved, their minds faltered; their magics weakened.  Amaurosis had his revenge: he bound Pelageus with a powerful magic, granting him near-eternal life, and removing his powers of speech.  So constricted, the thrall became the master, and Pelageus has been forced since to wander the black caverns, unspeaking, unable to call the great magics that were his fame.
PELAGEUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Pelageus attempts to speak, but his mouth is fused shut by magic.
OLD_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=old lord
OLD_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=an old lord
OLD_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In legend, an ancient group of lords led their men against a tribe of primitive men.  The lords led their men to victory, but at a terrible cost: a group of shamans cursed the lords, binding the spirits of the lords and shamans for eternity.  These fused spirits have the ghostly appearance of the lords themselves, but this is only the shell - the spirits are the shamans themselves, driven by the hatred of death and the slaughter of their people.  Over millennia, these spirits have grown in power, and are whispered about, feared, lest they should somehow appear.  Even the term "old lord" is borne out of this, a term careful not to name any of the shamans, or even mention the shamans themselves.
OLD_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The old lord's face draws back into a hateful glare.
STEEL_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=steel slime
STEEL_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a steel slime
STEEL_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A super-massive slime even larger than the king slimes, steel slimes are enormous, magical slimes that slither and crawl aggressively.  When threatened, they are able through some process to harden, forming a temporary shell that renders them very difficult to damage.  The shell that they form is harder than iron.  It has a strange sparkling quality that some say is due to magic, while more practical people suspect is due to the reaction of unstable acids.  Steel slimes have the most powerful acids of any slime, jelly, or ooze, able to corrode armour in an instant, searing flesh and bone alike.
STEEL_SLIME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The steel slime flashes silver and grey.
SKELETON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton
SKELETON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton
SKELETON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton fixes you with its soulless gaze.
SKELETON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skeletons are the bones of the dead infused with unholy magics to give them form once more.  The bones are weakly separated by magic.  Sudden movements cause the bones to bounce and click, and combined with the scraps of armour buried with the dead, this lends skeletons a tell-tale clattering sound that serves to announce their presence.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal warrior's jaws clatter loudly.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Necromancy is only as good as the bodies it animates, and skeletal warriors are good bodies indeed.  The skeletal remains of warriors, soldiers, and mercenaries, the animation creates a skeleton that is cunning, quick, and absolutely lethal.  Skeletal warriors usually wear a few ill-fitting scraps of armour, their claw-like hands grasping a sword that remains as keen in death as it was in life.
MUMMY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mummy
MUMMY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mummy
MUMMY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mummy opens its mouth and you are assaulted by a thousand years of decay.
MUMMY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most things die, they are buried or burned, and their bodies return to the earth. Sometimes, though, the body can be preserved long after death, and then possessed by evil spirits who exert their will through the decaying form. These creatures are mummies, fearful things who shamble slowly but possess an incredible strength.
ARDU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ardu's voice is a sickly rasp, his words of a language lost to time.
ARDU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great warrior of a forgotten empire, Ardu was protector to a great line of kings until he was deeply wounded in battle.  After dying shortly thereafter, his spirit was captured by witch-magic, forced to forever protect the sanctity of the ancient tombs.
SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shade
SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shade
SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shade releases an anguished scream.
SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of the recent dead, shades are the corporeal shadows of corpses, imbued with unholy life.  Shades roughly resemble the person they once were, but with formless features.  Their eyes are a milky white, their skin soft and black, with a velvet-like texture.  The touch of shades is much feared: full of the essence of shadow and darkness, it can cause the petrification and slow death of its victims, leaving behind a stiff, almost statue-like corpse.
LICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lich
LICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lich
LICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lich murmurs, "Ic com on thisse blaec daeg for eower lif."
LICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lich is a fearsome creature, born from fusing black magic into the body of a great sorceror.  Years of death waste away the muscle tissue so that the skin stretches taught over nothing but bone.  And these years of unlife and study render the lich capable of unleashing terrible magics.  Cloaked in the tattered robes it wore in life, the lich's gaze is unmistakable, two embers burning beneath the shadow of the cowl.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal dragon rears back its head and releases a silent roar.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To create a skeleton requires effort and concentration, for the will of the creature must be battled and overcome when unlife fills the body.  Because of this, few sorcerors attempt to reanimate the bones of a dragon.  Those that try usually end up crushed immediately by the dragon's tail, or impaled on the razor-teeth of its maw.  It is said that the great spellbinders of a previous age kept skeletal dragons as a sign of their personal power, the names of these wizards found carved on runic tablets deep in caves: Pelle, Falamar, and Wealhwin.
REAPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=reaper
REAPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a reaper
REAPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The reaper's empty expression seems fixed on you.
REAPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Agents of death and the afterlife, reapers are sad creatures forced to cull the marked living for all eternity.  Black-cloaked and wraith-like, reapers carry massive, wicked scythes which they use to end the lives of the living and send their souls to the world below.
PLAYER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The player is like a sparrow flying through a feasting-hall: they get glimpses of light and laughter, a few brief moments of happiness and warmth, before flying back into the darkness.  The great philosopher Hobbes wrote that the life is, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"; applied to the player, this seems particularly apt.
PLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=You make a scene by speaking to yourself.
RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rat
RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rat
RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, long-tailed rodent with fur ranging from black to brown to grey, rats are ubiquitous in all parts of the world.  It is thought that they originated in the great central lands, and then made their way from island to island either by swimming or ship, depending on the distance.  A tiny, frail creature, the rat is nonetheless known to attack when hungry, capable of dealing some damage using its sharp teeth.
RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rat squeaks.
MOLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mole
MOLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mole
MOLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small subterranean mammals, moles are blinded by their habitat, unable to see at all.  However, their other senses are strong: moles can smell very well, and have an incredible sense of hearing.  Moles are not large, rarely growing more than a foot in size, but they have sharp teeth and claws, and will defend themselves if provoked.
MOLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mole squeaks at you.
GHOST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghost
GHOST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghost
GHOST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Spirits of the once-living, ghosts are caught in a land of eternal twilight, never living, never dead.  It is said that they are forced by fate to roam the earth, shackled between worlds due to unsettled business.  They often appear near where they once lived, unnerving the living, frightening pets and livestock.  Ghosts tend to look much the same as their former selves, but transparent, and untroubled by walls and doors.
GHOST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghost's face becomes pure grief, pure sorrow.
FOX_MAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox mage
FOX_MAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox mage
FOX_MAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the legends of many low-land peoples, the fox plays the part of trickster.  Surely this is partially due to its appearance, long-snouted and quick, but a number of these legends share some eerily common threads.  In them, the fox is said to take the form of a human traveller, appearing as a hooded man sometime around twilight.  These are no myth.  The creatures are demons from the black plain, neither good nor evil, but beings that exist outside the bonds of moral philosophy.  Possessing of a clear, quick intelligence, they command oracular magics capable of debilitating those they find threatening.  It is said that those who cross them are found beside the roadside, their faces bitten and torn beyond all recognition.
FOX_MAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox mage peers at you from beneath its hood.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most great warriors pass, they are surrounded by family and friends, sent off to the afterlife by those they loved most in life.  But there are some who do not make it so far.  Every warrior carries with himself the ones he killed; those without anyone to help shoulder the burden in life become transformed in death, taking spectral form.  From within the armour, their eyes burn endlessly, still haunted, still trapped, unable to find peace.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=From beneath its visor, the spectral knight stares at you, its ghostly eyes a pair of burning coals.
QUILLICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quillich
QUILLICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quillich
QUILLICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A man-eating creature described by legend, the quillich is a fearsome creature that lives deep underground, emerging only briefly into the world above.  Its body is covered with rock-like protusions that resemble a porcupine's quills, hence its name.  With sharp teeth and claws, it burrows slowly, making its way through caverns and dungeons to feast on the unwary.
QUILLICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quillich shrieks.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wizards spend their lives in study, researching magics known and unknown.  During their studies and travels, some will commune with elemental and demonic creatures.  The most greedy, the most eager for fame will trade their soul for powerful magics, and that debt is always collected.  After the wizard dies, his spirit is shackled to the earth, bound by his word to walk until the world's end.  But though the body rots, the mind remains sharp, and spectral wizards will unleash torrential magics on those unfortunate enough to interrupt their travels.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral wizard murmurs something in an ancient tongue.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The unsettled spirits of ancient lords and ladies, spectral lords are powerful apparitions caught between the worlds.  Long after the body wastes away and becomes absorbed by the earth, spectral lords walk the heaths and fens, the reign of their houses long past.  They remain dressed in their death-clothes, and carry blades imbued with powerful magics, given to them in death to carry to the next life.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral lord says nothing, its mouth open in a voiceless scream.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There have been a number of recorded empires throughout history, and others lost to time.  At the head of each is an emperor, or less often, an empress.  Each are sent to the afterlife with a lavish array of gifts: gold and silver, beautiful weapons and armour, even their favoured guards, family, and pets.  But sometimes this is not enough, and the spirit persists.  Spectral emperors roam far beyond the life of their empires, watching the rise and fall of many peoples, watching the mountains grow and shrink, never happy, never able to slip the earth and ascend into the world beyond.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral emperor stares through you.
THE_SORCEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Sorceror
THE_SORCEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Sorceror
THE_SORCEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Standing stooped, his back twisted and hunched, The Sorceror has mastered magical arts far beyond those recorded in any book.  He can reach into the heavens, pulling down comets and starfire, or unleash the terrifying cold of the cosmos.  But in Telari, he acts as gatekeeper between worlds.  It is he who works great acts of illusion and shielding, ensuring the Nine remain unaware that in the cataclysm of Aurelion's wrath, that there were some who survived.  These spells come at a terrible cost, however, deforming The Sorceror, and twisting him in terrible pain.  He stands bent over in a deep bow, his arms bent and crooked, his legs bandy.  Despite this, his face remains placid and unreadable, and when he speaks, his lips barely move.
THE_SORCEROR_GATEWAY_TEXT_SID="I can send you back," murmurs The Sorceror, "but at a cost.  This world has not yet cooled; its magics are very raw."
THE_SORCEROR_GATEWAY_TEXT2_SID="Be warned," he says.  "The way back is fraught.  You will come back weaker, and will not regain that strength."
THE_SORCEROR_ARTIFACT_TEXT_SID="I see you have something to offer."
THE_SORCEROR_ARTIFACT_CONFIRM_TEXT_SID=The artifact disappears in a blinding flash of magic.  Suddenly, you are caught up in a gargantuan vortex.  The world spins and goes black...
THE_SORCEROR_NO_ARTIFACT_TEXT_SID="If you were to offer an artifact, I could focus the magics, and send you back to your world."
THE_SENTRY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Sentry
THE_SENTRY_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Sentry
THE_SENTRY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When the hammer struck, when the lands were shattered, a series of enormous tidal waves crashed across the earth, drowning an untold number.  Before it did, the wave was spotted far off by The Sentry.  She called out an alert, and as the wave struck, everything vanished.  But not everything was destroyed.  A few of the builders created a great magic, and with it, they escaped with the Cloudspire.  Now, The Sentry continues to watch - not with her eyes, but with her other senses.  She lies on the seabed, beneath a layer of comet jellyfish, the darkness lit by their strange colours.  Her vigil is eternal: uneating, unmoving, she maintains an eternal vigil against the hateful wrath of the Nine.
THE_SENTRY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Sentry says, "I lie on this ridgetop, seemingly in sleep, alert for every second, searching the waves for divine intent."
THE_SENTRY_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Sentry looks at you in awe.  "It's done?  It's finally done?"
COMET_JELLYFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=comet jellyfish
COMET_JELLYFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a comet jellyfish
COMET_JELLYFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=With a bell like a small boulder, and streaking tentacles that trail upwards, the comet-tailed jellyfish is a fearsome predator.  Its tentacles release not a toxin, but a powerful and piercing electric charge, capable of disabling everything around it.  Despite this, they are strangely beautiful: largely motionless, they let the direction of the current guide them, and they light up the deep ocean with flashes of rich and brilliant colour.
THE_WORLDSINGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Worldsinger
THE_WORLDSINGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Worldsinger
THE_WORLDSINGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is for the philosophers to decide whether written or oral histories are more robust.  The former certainly allow vast sums of knowledge to be recorded, but the medium is problematic: clay shatters; paper burns.  Oral histories, passed from one singer or poet to the next, can lose details over many generations, though the basic ideas remain intact, and myths can survive tens of thousands of years of retelling.  The Elysians maintain an oral history through song, retelling their major events as long verses, each verse sung as a variation on the previous.  The Worldsinger is the last of these bardic figures.  He sits in the west wing of the tower, facing a set of irregular foundation stones: the first naming stones, those that contain the divine names of the Nine themselves.  And after focusing on these, he raises his voice, and sings.
THE_WORLDSINGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Worldsinger says, "Our history is long, and complicated.  Hundreds of thousands of years ago, I set it to song."
THE_WORLDSINGER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="When we were purged by the Nine, our written records were destroyed.  We kept such beautiful libraries.  But some part our history still lives."
THE_WORLDSINGER_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="The divine fools sought to eliminate us.  But we survived, cloaked in deep magics in this water-world, beneath our frigid sea."
THE_WORLDSINGER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Worldsinger's expression is a mixture of elation and sadness.  "It is done!  The old songs end, and new ones must begin."
THE_SPEAKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Speaker
THE_SPEAKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Speaker
THE_SPEAKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Elysians are less organized than most societies.  In most societies, leadership is either established by force and blood, in the case of kings and emperors, or by the people, as with presidents and councillors.  The Elysians are different in that they select a leader by consensus.  This is not, however, established by formal methods such as a written vote.  Instead, it is by a common understanding that there is one person best to speak.  The Elysians have had two speakers in their history, and the first was killed by Aurelion's wrath.  The second Speaker is tall, with very dark skin - almost black - and long, red hair.  Her eyes are a piercing and unblinking green, and she speaks softly but compellingly, her voice authoritative and firm.
THE_SPEAKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Speaker's voice is soft and commanding.  "Welcome, traveller.  This is Telari, the Cloudspire, Pillar of the East."
THE_SPEAKER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="It is beautiful and fantastic, full of the kind of deep magics long extinct from your world."
THE_SPEAKER_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="Long ago, three of us began the climb, waiting for the day when someone like you would finally arrive."
THE_SPEAKER_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID="The Conjurer waits with great magics, The Armourer with a great gift.  And at the peak, The Smith, with the God-Blade."
THE_SPEAKER_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID="Beware: once you begin your ascent, you cannot return until you have become the God-Slayer."
THE_SPEAKER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Speaker regards you softly, and begins to speak.  "After so many years, so many uncountable years, the divine comedy has come to a close."
THE_SPEAKER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="Now comes a better age - of philosophy and thinking, logic and rational thought.  Runes and magic will fade away, and science will have its day."
THE_CONJURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Conjurer
THE_CONJURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Conjurer
THE_CONJURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Perhaps the oldest of those who survived, The Conjurer learned his magics early in the history of the world, when the possible was limitless, and great powers awaited those who delved.  But as the great magics left the world, he remained their keeper, able to call forces unheard of by man or elf, or even the old fair folk who once walked the earth.  Some of these magics are purely internal, like witchlings' conjurings; others, he wrote down, encoded in the runic script.  These books he keeps somewhere else, making them appear in an instant, to be consulted, before vanishing again.
THE_CONJURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Conjurer watches you closely from beneath his cowl.
THE_CONJURER_PRIMORDIAL_TEXT_SID=The Conjurer says, "There is more to the universe than we can observe.  For each thing there is an un-thing, an antimatter."
THE_CONJURER_PRIMORDIAL_TEXT2_SID="It can exist in our presence for but a second, an apocalyptic energy.  I shall teach you to call it."
THE_CONJURER_PRIMORDIAL_TEXT3_SID=The Conjurer's eyes glitter.  "There is one other thing I know - how to briefly tear apart the fabrics of the universe itself."
THE_CONJURER_PRIMORDIAL_TEXT4_SID="Incalculably powerful, it relies on magics almost faded from thought.  It is intensely localized, and can only be used directly in front of you."
THE_CONJURER_PRIMORDIAL_TEXT5_SID="You could annihilate a god with it, witchling!  But to allow the Nine next to you would be very foolish, indeed."
THE_CONJURER_WAND_TEXT_SID=From beneath his robe, The Conjurer produces a long and twisted wand.  It radiates a green-red glow.
THE_CONJURER_WAND_TEXT2_SID="Take this wand, adventurer.  It contains powerful magics."
THE_CONJURER_SPELLBOOK_TEXT_SID=The Conjurer nods.  "You read Old Runic?  It is not so old to me.  A group of us codified it - in our texts, on slats of stone."
THE_CONJURER_SPELLBOOK_TEXT2_SID="Yes!  I am its creator, its living lexicographer.  And I have something for you in your fight against the heavens."
THE_CONJURER_SPELLBOOK_TEXT3_SID=From nowhere, a book flutters down, landing at your feet with a flourish.
THE_CONJURER_SPELLBOOK_TEXT4_SID="Learn these words and you are greater than the high wizards!  Greater than the Dragon Lords!  Perhaps, greater than the Nine!"
THE_CONJURER_CANTRIPS_TEXT_SID=The Conjurer muses, "Old Runic is required to read the most powerful spells, but there are still great magics in lesser languages."
THE_CONJURER_CANTRIPS_TEXT2_SID=He flicks his wrist, and a spellbook appears before you.  "I trust you will find this useful."
THE_CONJURER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Conjurer looks stricken.  "My books!  The writing is beginning to fade!  Oh, adventurer, the old magics are truly dead, now."
THE_CONJURER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="I am become a hedge-wizard, mere conjurer of petty magics.  Look!"  He summons a torrent of flame, and you flinch back - but it is just illusion.
THE_CONJURER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=He shakes his head sadly.  "What shall they say of Ixthilion?  Yes, use my name, adventurer.  It has no power now."
THE_ARMOURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Armourer
THE_ARMOURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Armourer
THE_ARMOURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Unlike the rest of the Elysians, who tend towards an unearthly kind of beauty, the Armourer is ugly and deformed.  His face is a lump of features - one eye higher than the other, sunken cheekbones; his hair is long and patchy, his earlobes missing altogether.  The fire in his forge is the intense heat of starfire, powerful and debilitating.  It has robbed him of any semblance of normalcy, but is potent, capable of forging and bonding much heavier metals than iron and steel.  With it, he creates splendid pieces of armour, the kind that the Nine themselves could wear: shining chain mail, massive roundshields, and terrifying, crested helms.
THE_ARMOURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Armourer says, "Climb, adventurer.  The divine drama awaits."
THE_ARMOURER_SPEECH_ARMOUR_SID=The Armourer turns his grotesque face toward you.  "Clamber, clamber.  This is Telari, the Cloudspire, the path to the heavens."
THE_ARMOURER_SPEECH_ARMOUR2_SID="At the peak, you will enter the cosmos, and find the Nine themselves.  They are terrifying, their strength beyond all reckoning."
THE_ARMOURER_SPEECH_ARMOUR3_SID="May this provide you with some measure of protection."
THE_ARMOURER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Armourer says softly, "My one love was killed in Aurelion's wrath.  Her name was Tabithe, and she was lovely as new snow on a winter's morning."
THE_ARMOURER_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="You have provided me some measure of closure after all these years, and for that, I thank you."
THE_SMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Smith
THE_SMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Smith
THE_SMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At the peak of the Cloudspire dwells The Smith.  Having forged many of the blades of myth - Apocalypse, Heaven's Blade, even the sword of the fairy-king, Tel - he waits atop Telari, by Heaven's Stair, for someone prepared to step into the cosmos and challenge The Nine.  His forge glows with a paralyzing, white-hot heat; rods of metal and crystallized magic sit nearby in neat stacks.  His skin is wrinkled and leathery, his hair thick and white, tied back with a strip of leather.  His eyes are a strange shade of yellow-black.  He does not appear to be armed: a battered hammer sits beside the forge, along with a few unfinished blades, but The Smith appears unconcerned with the dangers of the mortal world.
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_UNARMED_SID=The Smith looks you over.  "A fighter, hmm?  So was I, in my younger days.  I fought men and monsters, beasts for which you have no names."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_UNARMED_NO_SLAY_SID="I even fought divine horrors!  Star-spawns, angelic beings, godlings - let me teach you their weaknesses."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_UNARMED_SLAY_SID="There is little more I can teach you about the weaknesses of the divine.  But your technique could be better.  Let me show you..."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_GODBLADE_SID=The Smith gives you a frenzied look.  "I am almost done!  Almost!  For months I have been slowly, imperceptibly, improving this sword."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_GODBLADE2_SID="No paltry cleaver!  This is something truly great, beyond the blades of fae and men.  A thing of magic, to cut apart the Nine themselves!"
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_GODBLADE3_SID=The Smith hammers furiously for several minutes, and then tempers his pace.  Suddenly, he quenches the blade in a bucket of brackish water.
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_GODBLADE4_SID=He pulls up the blade, slowly.  It shines with an unearthly light.  He applies a film of oil to a whetstone, and begins to hone the sword.
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_GODBLADE5_SID=Finally satisfied, he looks it over, and lays it out at your feet.  "This," he says softly, "is the God-Blade."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_SHARD_SID=The Smith looks you over.  "I've rarely seen coordination like yours, adventurer.  I think I have something that you may find useful."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_SHARD2_SID="In days gone by, when we were mining deep within the earth, we found a vein of pure magic.  Using all my skill, I worked it into a small blade."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_SHARD3_SID="That might be generous - it's more of a dagger.  But it's something special.  It cuts through dragonscale and magic and godflesh alike."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_SHARD4_SID="I've never made anything quite like it.  The Worldsinger calls it the Shard of Starlight.  Take it, and may it serve you well."
THE_SMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="Go!" barks The Smith.  "Climb Heaven's Stair, and make your fate!"
THE_SMITH_GODSLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Smith looks startled at your reappearance, and his face breaks into an enormous grin.
THE_SMITH_RANGED_GIFT_SID=The Smith grins.  "The humble peltast, that fearless one who with sling or bow or javelin stands exposed, staring down an infantry or cavalry charge."
THE_SMITH_RANGED_GIFT2_SID="Forgotten or ignored by history, how many of their names do we know?  Well, here you stand, conqueror of Telari.  And I have not forgotten you."
THE_SMITH_RANGED_GIFT3_SID="I have a gift for you.  I trust it will serve you well."
THE_BUILDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Builder
THE_BUILDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Builder
THE_BUILDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Last crafter of the great shrines that mark the boundaries of the world, The Builder is an older woman: grey haired, white eyed, her pallid skin gives her the appearance of being made from stone.  A master mason effortlessly able to fuse magic with the mundane, she possesses a singular patience, able to work decade after decade on a single set of stones, fitting them perfectly into one another, ensuring that her creations will still stand long after the sun goes out.
THE_BUILDER_STAIRCASE_SID=The Builder nods in appreciation.  "The final naming stone.  So, it has come to this - a cosmic recoking, an end to the divine comedy."
THE_BUILDER_STAIRCASE2_SID="As the stair to heaven opens, the stair to the ocean closes.  Go!  Meet the Nine at the centre of their celestial realm."
THE_BUILDER_STAIRCASE3_SID="Their death will close off the cosmos, and allow you to descend again."
THE_BUILDER_IGNORE_SID=The Builder ignores you, making small repairs to bits of mortar.
ANCIENT_TERROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient terror
ANCIENT_TERROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ancient terror
ANCIENT_TERROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Like some sort of terrifying embodiment of darkness and night, ancient terrors lurk at the corners of the world.  Six-armed, bat-winged, they are said to be tall as titans and wrathful as wyrms.  The tales of them speak of leathery skin, patchy with feathers; and face that look something like men, but smoother, more featureless, the eyes larger, the mouths hooked and full of teeth.  Well known in antiquity, it is written that the sorceror Brasidus attempted to summon one, and bind it to his will.  He was torn apart and devoured, the city-state of Aracha laid to waste, its great standing stones the only remnants on that far, north-eastern isle.
ANCIENT_TERROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient terror fixes you with its blazing eyes and screams.
MELURA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Melura
MELURA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Melura
MELURA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fae are notorious for taking lovers only within their small and fading community.  But very occasionally, an exception is made.  During the days of the Kell Empire, Melura's father, a fae, and her mother, a wood elf, met, fell deeply in love, and ran away.  They were never seen again, knowing that they would be pariahs, but years later their daughter emerged from far-off lands.  Restless and wilful, she spent her extremely elongated life charting dungeons and caverns, challenging ancient beasts, and amassing great fortune.  Now in the twilight of her life, she lives with her mother's kin, not accepted, but not rejected, either.  Far older than they, she lives at the outskirts of Yew, happy to train those who seek her counsel.
MELURA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="Greetings, adventurer!" says Melura.  "What can I help you train?"
MELURA_SPEECH_STATISTIC_SID=[a] Strength, [b] Dexterity, [c] Agility, [d] Health, [e] Intelligence, [f] Willpower, [g] Charisma
MELURA_SPEECH_AMOUNT_SID="And how much do you want to pay?" 
MELURA_BAD_INPUT_SID="Sorry, adventurer, I don't understand your moon language."
MELURA_NSF_SID=Melura glares at you.  "You clearly don't have that kind of money."
MELURA_STAT_IMPROVED_SID=Melura smiles.  "There!  You seem a little less terrible already."
MELURA_STAT_MAX_MARKED_SID=Melura hands back your money.  "You should see the fruits of your efforts soon.  Come see me once you do."
HELLBORE_BEETLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hellbore beetle
HELLBORE_BEETLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hellbore beetle
HELLBORE_BEETLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be no more than a myth, the hellbore beetle recently destroyed those notions in terrifying fashion, with two of the insects boring up from the earth to consume a number of villages before disappearing back into their massive hole.  The few that survived told of insects larger than a dragons, and faster, too.  Their jaws drip with a corrosive acid, and their backs are said to have a distinctive purple-red pattern, under which lie a pair of wings that allow flight for brief periods.  Since the attack, there have been no sightings of these terrifying creatures, though it is thought that they live deep underground in caverns or abandoned dungeons.
HELLBORE_BEETLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hellbore beetle rears up.
CORPSE_RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The corpse rat is a large subspecies of the common rat, typically growing to three times the size.  Instantly recognizable by its sickly grey fur, the corpse rat makes its burrow within the carcasses of fallen creatures, both sheltering and feeding within the carrion.  Corpse rats are known to be fearless, attacking creatures many times their size, regardless of the peril.
CORPSE_RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse rat squeaks.
GREEN_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=green slime
GREEN_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a green slime
GREEN_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature of some ancient magic, green slimes bubble and ooze, lurching strangely towards anything that approaches.  They try to envelop the creature, slowly dissolving it while slowing the natural rotting process.  Depending on the size of the creature, this may keep the slime fed for weeks, or even months.
IMP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=imp
IMP_DESCRIPTION_SID=an imp
IMP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Imps are small, magical creatures, barely two feet in height.  Vaguely human in appearance, they are nonetheless very ugly, with squat, twisted features.  Descended from some common ancestor as the fae, they share a common wilfulness and sense of mischief.  They are thought to live deep underground, in caverns accessible only through the trunks of rotted trees.  When provoked, they attack with slim, stone-bladed knives.
IMP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The imp chitters incomprehensively.
GOBLIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin
GOBLIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin
GOBLIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are short, cunning humanoids with sharp features and sharper teeth.  They live in small tribes on the outer islands, though recently they have been spotted closer and closer to the centre lands.   Despite their smaller size, they are ferocious creatures, afraid of nothing.  They wear ratty, tattered clothing, and are skilled with their sharp, curved blades.
GOBLIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin chuckles, "You would make a fine stew, I think!"
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin trapper
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin trapper
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Like the gnomes, goblins delight in complex mechanical devices.  But gnomes use this love for their own betterment, while goblins are beings of evil and chaos.  Many of them that wander world bring with them rocks, crossbow bolts, arrows - anything that they can rig up at a moment's notice.  These traps litter the dungeons, hung from ceilings, tucked into crevices, or buried beneath the floor.  Trappers themselves are quite distinctive, wearing wide-brimmed hats and layers of fox-furs as protection against the heat and cold of the upper world, and the ruins beneath it.
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin trapper cackles, "Don't bolt! I'm going to rock you!"
CHAOSLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chaosling
CHAOSLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chaosling
CHAOSLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the most minor denizens of the black plains, chaoslings are tiny little demons with a penchant for mischief.  Mercurial and temperamental, they glow with flame one second, holy fire the next.  They find their way out of the black plains and proceed to curdle milk, snatch housecats, burn cakes.  They enjoy watching the chaos that ensues, and dart back down as soon as they're discovered.
CHAOSLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chaosling cackles with glee.
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins often form raiding parties, sailing out on small boats to loot settlements and slake their thirst for blood.  Owing to their small size, a number never return.  But over time, the veterans of these campaigns grow stronger, and more cunning.  Clad in the best armour, wielding the finest swords, these champions become the leaders of their comrades and are known to be formidable foes.
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin champion cackles mercilessly.
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin elite guard
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin elite guard
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblin chieftains get where they are not by birth or election, but by cold steel.  And as a result, they make many enemies along the way.  As protection, they retain guardsmen, the most dangerous of which are the elite guard.  Taken from the greatest of the raiders and champions, the elite guard are imposing figures.  They dress in full chain armour, typically wielding a polearm such as a halberd or spear, and wear as a helm the skull of a lion, boar, or bear.
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin elite guard yells,  "Halt!"
GOBLIN_IMPALER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin impaler
GOBLIN_IMPALER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin impaler
GOBLIN_IMPALER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are a cruel race, it is said, enjoying the cries of lesser and weaker creatures.  The most cruel are impalers, and serve as the shock troops of the raiding parties.  They carry savage, barbed spears, meant to cause massive bleeding and strike fear.  After combat, they skin their foes, wearing the bloody, irregular skins as capes.  The heads they wear as necklaces or pauldrons, the flesh slowly rotting until the skull is bare.  The civilized peoples of the world fear and loathe goblin impalers, and those that are captured are given summary deaths, the bodies left for crows.
GOBLIN_IMPALER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin impaler grins, wide-mouthed, like the skulls it wears.
CAHRI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cahri
CAHRI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cahri
CAHRI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young snakeling woman, Cahri left the Snake Lands to pursue her way in the world.  After a short spell as a soldier, and then sell-sword, she turned her attention to the plunder of the ancient underground caverns and complexes that litter the landscape.  A dungeoneer by trade, she wears tight-fitting, flexible clothing covered by bits of scavenged armour.  At her waist sits a pair of battered falchions.  Her name is spoken in whispers among adventurers - a worthy companion in the depths when things get dangerous, it is said, but not to be trusted, not for one second.
CAHRI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cahri eyes you up, her eyes fierce and cold.

At night, they stomp and roar, the sounds echoing up through the rock to the world above.
MINOTAUR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The minotaur bellows in rage.
HYDRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hydra
HYDRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hydra
HYDRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A many-headed serpent steeped in myth, hydras typically live in swamps and wetlands.  They are also known to live in any caves and caverns with a sufficient amount of water to sustain them.  Hydras are venemous, and due to their many heads, capable of injecting huge amounts of a powerful toxin into their victims.
HYDRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hydras many heads hiss in rage.
NIGHTMARE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nightmare
NIGHTMARE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nightmare
NIGHTMARE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A coal-coloured mare from the black plains, the nightmare appears as from a terrifying dream.  Its eyes are bright red, and burn like small embers.  Wisps of smoke trail from its nostrils as it snorts, and from its mouth, it breathes short bursts of flame.  Many people believe that nightmares are forerunners, and that those who see them will die soon after.
NIGHTMARE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nightmare shrieks.
RED_OOZE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=red ooze
RED_OOZE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a red ooze
RED_OOZE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Red oozes are unsentient magical oozes that thrive in moisture-rich environments.  They attempt to engulf nearby objects, whereby a magical process converts the matter into intense heat.  Easily identifiable by their bright red glow, red oozes bubble about, moving slowly, but striking quickly.  They typically feed on small animals, often rats or mice, but can be quite dangerous and are known to be able to expand to several times their apparent size.
SELLSWORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sellsword
SELLSWORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sellsword
SELLSWORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The sellsword is a skilled swordsman with few loyalties.  His services are available to the highest bidder, and can change as quickly as new bid is received.  Sellswords are not rich men, making enough to scrape by.  They tend to wear scraps of leather and mail: enough to protect some key areas, but not enough to hinder their movement.  But if their armour is suspect, their weapon is not.  Their swords are always well-made and well-tended, sharpened daily, and always ready for use.
SELLSWORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sellsword says, "It's nothing personal, adventurer, but I will kill you."
MUCK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=muck
MUCK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a muck
MUCK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mucks are found typically in dungeons.  A blue-grey in colour, they blend well with their surroundings, relying on the element of surprise to take advantage of the unsuspecting.  Being more viscous than other members of the jelly family, they are able to gather themselves and form into shapes.  Those who have survived their powerful acid have spoken of being attacked by gelatinous swords, hammers, and spears, speaking perhaps to some sort of intelligence or memory on the part of the muck. 
MUCK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The muck rises and rears up.
GRIFFIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=griffin
GRIFFIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a griffin
GRIFFIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The griffin is a majestic creature found high in the mountains, guarding treasure hoards teeming with artifacts and gold.

Their shaggy hair is caked with blood, and their mouths open to several rows of pointed, rotting teeth.
RAM_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ram demon stomps and snorts.
ANGEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=angel
ANGEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an angel
ANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Heavenly creatures, the divine creation of the Nine, angels live in the heavens, where they watch over the people of the world.

ANGEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The angel chants, "Holy, holy, holy."
UNICORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=unicorn
UNICORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a unicorn
UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A fabled animal of purity, the unicorn is a white mare with a spiral horn in the centre of its head.  It lives in the deep woodlands and fields, far from civilization.  While not unfriendly, the unicorn is untrusting and fearful, liable to lash out when approached.  Unicorn horns have long been thought to have magical healing properties, able to cure sickness, poison, and the most grievous wounds.
UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The unicorn whinnies.
BLACK_UNICORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The counter-balance to the unicorn, the black unicorn is a creature of shadow and darkness.  Lacking the horn of its white counterpart, the black unicorn instead has a non-functional pair of wings.  It is for this reason that it is sometimes known as a "black pegasus".  Black unicorns are greatly feared for their aggressiveness, attacking with pure chaos and entropy, dissipating into shadow when finally slain.
BLACK_UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black unicorn whinnies.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are inherently war-like, and many become raiders, creating war-parties that sail to distant shores to pillage settlements and pilfer gold.  Goblin raiders are the members of these crews.  They carry long spears, and wear bits of armour taken from the dead.  As well, they have a gruesome custom of removing the heads and arms of their victims.  The raiders line the masts of their ships with the skulls, and tie the arm-bones near the heads of their spears, creating an ugly clacking sound.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin raider laughs, "Your head would look good on my pike!"
GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golem
GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a golem
GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Golems are powerful, mindless creations fused by the combination of magic, divinity, and clay.  In folklore, powerful sages created man-like forms from mud and clay, providing the spark of life from arcane knowledge and faithful prayer.  Golems are effective protectors of their creators.  Able to fight without fear and pain, they bring to bear great physical force, fighting until their life force is finally extinguished.
MAMMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mammoth
MAMMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mammoth
MAMMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mammoth is an enormous, elephantine mammal with shaggy fur that ranges from tan to black.  They are heard even before they are seen, for their stamping shakes the earth, and their trunks bellow and blare louder than a trumpet.  Though they are far from extinct, their numbers are less than in the past, for the ivory from their tusks is considered the greatest and purest, and is widely sought.
MAMMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A mammoth bellows.
SKELETON_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When the bodies of mere mortals are fused with dark magics, they produce skeletons; when the body of a great warrior or king is treated the same, the result is the horrifying skeleton king.  Resembling a normal skeleton but garbed in robes or armour, skeleton kings' status in life becomes its power in death.  They are frighteningly quick.  Rather than shamble, they run at a full sprint, sword drawn, ready to make short work of all that stand in their way.
SKELETON_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton king laughs silently, and its jaws click and clatter.
DEMON_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demon lord
DEMON_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demon lord
DEMON_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Demon lords are the lesser rulers of the black plains, granted dominion over a small parcel of land and its inhabitants.  They are intelligent, organized, well-studied, and incredibly strong.  They superficially resemble men and women, though much bulkier.  Their skin ranges from red to black, their eyes burn like embers, and their voices are a deep and rumbling growl.  Demon lords wear fine raiment and carry swords that burn with an unearthly light.  
DEMON_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demon lord cackles, and his blade glows with magical fire.
ARCHANGEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=archangel
ARCHANGEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an archangel
ARCHANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the highest of the celestial beings, archangels are the devout servants of the Nine, ready to help their servants and smite their foes.  They have a vaguely human appearance, though their blazing, golden aura makes it impossible to ascertain.  Their voices are pure music, sounding like flutes, horns, and trumpets, used to sing praise to the ones they serve.
ARCHANGEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The archangel exclaims, "Glory be to the Nine!"
COSMIC_INFERNO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cosmic inferno
COSMIC_INFERNO_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cosmic inferno
COSMIC_INFERNO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Some sort of extra-terrestrial race hailing from the core of planets, cosmic infernos appear as massive, black flames.  Intensely destructive, they do not distinguish friend from foe, burning through everything before them.  They appear only briefly, creating a wide swath of destruction before vanishing again.
COSMIC_INFERNO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cosmic inferno spits and crackles.
TROGLODYTE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=troglodyte
TROGLODYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troglodyte
TROGLODYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Distant cousins of man, troglodytes are short humanoids who dwell deep in caves and mountains, almost as deep as dwarves.  They stand just over five feet in height, and are much more dense and powerful than humans.  Their features are more compact, too, with close-set eyes, blocky noses, and hunched frames.  They wear tanned hides and furs, and favour simple, heavy clubs.
TROGLODYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A troglodyte spits a few words of a low, guttural tongue.
TROLL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=troll
TROLL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troll
TROLL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Trolls live at the fringes of civilization: in caves and caverns, deep in swamps, under bridges.  They are the enormous and dim-witted kin of ogres, very distantly related.  Warty, filthy, and stupid, they make up for their shortcomings with immense strength.  They rip apart their prey with their bare hands, feasting on flesh and marrow, leaving the broken bones scattered around their lairs like so much debris.
TROLL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The troll rears its head back and roars.
BEHOLDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=beholder
BEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a beholder
BEHOLDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Rising from the depths of the black plains, beholders levitate by magical force, hovering several feet above the ground.  Beholders resemble a giant eye atop a cackling mouth, surrounded by a mass of writhing tentacles.  Electrically charged, the eye of the beholder is known to paralyze its prey, holding it in place while the teeth and tentacles devour it alive.
BEHOLDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The beholder laughs, baring its lips back over rows of sharpened teeth.
DYING_STAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dying star
DYING_STAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dying star
DYING_STAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of some distant world, dying stars are globes of intensely burning gas.  They are well-known because their colours often change quickly: from red, to yellow, to white, cyan, and blue.  As they get hotter, they become increasingly dangerous, moving faster and burning with a terrifying intensity.  It's said that there is hope, though - for they cannot sustain bursts of great heat for long, and eventually restart the process, becoming a weak, slow-burning red light.
DYING_STAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Song-like voice appears in your head, its meaning unknowable.
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire elemental
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire elemental
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Servants of the Nine, fire elementals rampage and destroy those who have angered the divine.  The few survivors have whispered of spiralling columns of flame, twisting and turning, a horrific cyclone of heat and destruction.  And as quickly as they appear, they are gone, disappearing in an instant with the completion of their work.  It is thought that fire elementals are favoured by Aurelion and Voros, but with no way to ascertain this, it remains scholarly speculation.
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire elemental blazes with unbearable heat.
TENTACLED_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tentacled horror
TENTACLED_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tentacled horror
TENTACLED_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Each of the Nine has their creations: Vedere made men, elves, and dwarves; Voros created the serpents and wyrms; Celeste created the seraphs and angels.  Sceadugenga extends his grasp through the writhing mass of tentacled horrors.  Tendrils of inky blackness that dim the very light around them, tentacled horrors arrive through tears in the fabric of the universe, rampaging through the realms of the living before disappearing once more.
DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dragon
DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dragon
DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mightiest of beasts, the dragon is a massive serpent capable of walking on four legs, or flying high into the heavens on its wings.  Dragons are wicked as they are strong, and greedy.  They love gold and gems, which they hoard within their lairs, high atop mountains or deep beneath the earth.  Their scales shimmer and are known to come in a range of colours, from dull greens to dark reds, silver, black, and blue.  All dragons are fire-breathers.  Their breath is death to the unwary, hot enough to melt steel and shatter bone.
DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dragon unleashes a roar that shakes the earth.
SYLPH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sylph
SYLPH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sylph
SYLPH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tiny air spirits, sylphs dance on the winds and currents of air, so quick as to be barely visible.  They resemble tiny, beautiful women, merry and capricious.  On their backs are delicate wings, which seem almost still as they move.  They charge the air as they dance and dive; if many sylphs gather together, then the result is surely storms.
SYLPH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sylph laughs, and her laughter carries on the sudden wind.
GITHRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=githra
GITHRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a githra
GITHRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Said to be the living embodiment of tiny, dead stars, the githra appear as perfect spheres of incomprehensible blackness, surrounded by a blazing ring of light.  They move quickly, zipping from place to place.  They dim their surroundings, bending the light towards them, and those that have angered them have found themselves surrounded by tendrils of living darkness.
GITHRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The githra rumbles ominously.
NAIAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=naiad
NAIAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a naiad
NAIAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When Vedere made the lakes and rivers, he made the naiads to watch over them.  Naiads are water spirits, moving through currents and under still waters.  When they appear before men, they take the form of impossibly beautiful women, long-haired and naked.  They speak some sort of ethereal language, their words sung sweet as music.  A naiad's beauty has charmed many to follow them into the water.  Many have drowned.  Those that survive talk of a delerium, sinking below the waves in a naiad's embrace, before breaking free of the spell, and surfacing.
NAIAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The naiad asks, "Won't you come join me in the river?"
DRYAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dryad
DRYAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dryad
DRYAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ancient tree-spirits, dryads inhabit the trees of the old-growth forests rarely walked by elf or man.  They can briefly take physical form, appearing as a beautiful man or woman; this is done, it is said, to lure travellers away from the dryad's tree.  For the dryad's life is tied to one particular tree, and should that tree be felled, the dryad will die with it.
DRYAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dryad looks at you shyly.
HARPY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=harpy
HARPY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a harpy
HARPY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange cross between woman and bird, the harpy lives far from civilization, terrorizing those misfortunate enough to cross her path.  Harpies have the torso and head of a woman.  Rather than arms, they possess huge wings, and a bird's taloned feet.  They possess little beauty, their faces having sharp features: grim mouths, sharp noses, narrow eyes.  They are unfriendly and ill-tempered, and think little of swooping in to attack unwary adventurers.
HARPY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The harpy shrieks.
CORPSE_FIEND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse fiend
CORPSE_FIEND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse fiend
CORPSE_FIEND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing every bit the undead, corpse fiends are something different indeed.  Stitched together from many forms, human and animal and monstrous, they are animated not by the unholy magics of undeath, but rather strange and ancient sorceries.  With bits of body and skin, their forms meld with tails and wings and paws.  They are automatons, mindless, and magical.  They attack furiously and without regard for good or evil, bent to the will of a wizard who has bound them with a singular and unknowable purpose.
CORPSE_FIEND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse fiend opens its mouth, revealing a writhing mass of worms.
OREAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=oread
OREAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=an oread
OREAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Naiads watch the lakes and rivers, dryads the ancient lowland forests; the great mountains are watched by the oreads, who are part of the mountain spruce and pines.  Tall, beautiful creatures, the oreads stand taller than the other nymphs and are regarded as the most dangerous.  Tall and lithe, they move very quickly.  Their open hands strike with the blunt force of heavy stones, and when threatened, it is said they give no quarter.
OREAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The oread regards you cooly.
CLERIC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cleric
CLERIC_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cleric
CLERIC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The clergy of the nine act in a number of different roles.  Some function as administrators, working in the central lands to administer the functioning of their churches and temples.  Others serve in the ministry, bringing the Word of the edges of the world.  Some live in large, opulent houses; some in bearskin tents among the nomadic tribes.  But all of them have a role to play in keeping the Nine's sacred flame burning against the darkness of the world.
CLERIC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cleric nods a greeting at you.
VAMPIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=vampire
VAMPIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a vampire
VAMPIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Masters of the night, vampires are undead lords who feast on the blood of the living.  Having made pacts with dark powers, vampires use their blood magic to hover silently, transform into creatures such as bats and rats, and charm the living with illusion and glamour.  They must feed regularly, requiring the blood of the living or else withering slowly, aging into the brittle, dry husk of an ancient corpse. 
VAMPIRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The vampire smiles, revealing a dark and bloody grin.
COLOSSUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=colossus
COLOSSUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a colossus
COLOSSUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Statues imbued with magical life-force, colossi can stand more than a hundred feet high.  They are painstakingly carved by master sculptors from a single block of marble or stone, before a sorceror performs the rites to animate the creation.  Typically serving as guardians, they stand watch over tombs and palaces, unmoving until an intruder is detected.  Then they rise, wordlessly, shaking the earth around them as they rush to attack.
QUADARI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quadari
QUADARI_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quadari
QUADARI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black spirits of the underworld, said to be the souls of wizards and priests, the quadari from the underworld and glide on the black nights.  They come for children, for the unwary, looking to bring new souls to the underworld far before their time.  Their touch is deathly cold.  When their victims are frozen, the quadari envelop them, and then fly back from whence they came, ripping the life from their prey and guiding the soul to the world beyond.
QUADARI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quadari glides through the air, its sound akin to a low wail.
WYVERN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyvern
WYVERN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyvern
WYVERN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Huge reptiles with features of both wyrms and dragons, wyverns are massive creatures that figure prominently in legend and myth.  They can stand on their two hind legs, but lack the two front legs of dragons; and, like dragons, they can take to the sky on their massive wings.  Wyverns lack the intelligence of their reptilian cousins, however, owning only the low intelligence of lizards and snakes.  They do not want for ferocity, and use their massive teeth and talons to tear apart the unwary.
WYVERN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyvern screeches.
SKRAELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skraeling
SKRAELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skraeling
SKRAELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skraelings are a tribe of men who live far to the north and south.  Dressed in the hides of seal, walrus, and bear, they hunt from hide covered boats with ivory-tipped spears and harpoons.  Working in groups, they hunt the massive black whales that prowl the northern sea-lanes, dividing the meat and blubber between their families.  In appearance, they tend to be slightly shorter than most men, with jet-black hair and dark skin, and speak a language understood only by them.
SKRAELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skraeling speaks to you in some indecipherable tongue.
MARVELLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Marvelle
MARVELLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Marvelle
MARVELLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A witchling cast out by her people for her innate, terrifying magics, Marvelle is a young woman forced to fend for herself.  A long scar down her right cheek speaks to her hermitic lifestyle.  She wears a simple cotton tunic, and wears a battered backpack.  Her walking stick is twisted and knotty.  Capped with a dragon in flight, it appears to glow with a strange, blue-grey light.  Her speech is soft and slow.  Almost inaudible, her voice seems rough from years of disuse.  She chooses her words hesitantly, unused to the speech of everyday people, awkward and fumbling except when calling her magics, which she unleashes with quick and practiced ferocity.
MARVELLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Marvelle watches you with curiosity.
AIR_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=air elemental
AIR_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an air elemental
AIR_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The most powerful of the elementals, air elementals are storms compressed into being.  They form in moments, wreak destruction, and dissipate in an instant.  It is said that air elementals are preceeded by a horrible whispering sound, one that builds in intensity until it becomes unbearably loud.  Formed by the Nine to punish the wicked, air elementals are thought to be favoured by the Lady and the Trickster.
AIR_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The air elemental spins about you, a dangerous and deafening roar.
TITAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=titan

TITAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The titan thunders, "Begone, mortal!"
BLACK_CREEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black creeper
BLACK_CREEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black creeper
BLACK_CREEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A primeval species of spider, black creepers are among the most feared of the insects.  They are marked by a distinctive, blue-black zig-zag pattern across their back.

Their nests are often underground burrows, marked by the undigestible possessions of their victims.
FLOATING_EYE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=floating eye
FLOATING_EYE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a floating eye
FLOATING_EYE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The bane of many an adventurer, the floating eye is a strange, magical creature found throughout the world.  Approximately the size of a large stone, they hover at eye-level above the ground, staring, unblinking.  They are able to stun their opponents with a small jolt of electricity.  This can cause paralysis, and has caused the slow death of many unwary explorers.
BARROW_SPIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=barrow spider
BARROW_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a barrow spider
BARROW_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Green-black arachnids that nest near the barrows of the newly dead, barrow spiders are smaller than an ivory piece but possess a concentrated venom capable of killing creatures many times their size.  Along with this fearsome reputation, they are also known for spinning beautiful and elaborate webs, considered by some to be a tribute to the nearby dead.
GREAT_SERPENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=great serpent
GREAT_SERPENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a great serpent
GREAT_SERPENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Great serpents are an ancient species of snake, older than recorded time.  The few that survive live far underground, or in ancient forests, or deep in marshlands.  Their scales are dull green in appearance, and their great fangs can bite bone and pierce steel.  The ancient Tome of Zork remarks that a huge fierce green snake once barred the way of the anonymous hero in the subterranean caverns.
GREAT_SERPENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The great serpent hisses.
REDBACK_SPIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=redback spider
REDBACK_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a redback spider
REDBACK_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Deep beneath the earth, redback spiders live in a life of total darkness.  Their poison is unique among arachnids in that it not only serves to break down the victim from within, but when reingested, acts as a quick healing agent on the spider's wounds.  Many adventuring parties have stumbled on a redback, and overestimating their chances, attacked - the screaming, lifeless husks of such groups can be found throughout the dungeons of the ancient world.
REDBACK_SPIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The redback spider stares at you unblinkingly.
CELESTIAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=celestial
CELESTIAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a celestial
CELESTIAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Servants of Celeste and the Lady, celestials are divine beings not quite as powerful as angels.  Lacking form, they appear as sound and song, the air shimmering in their presence.  It is believed that they act as divine messengers, bringing a message incomprehensible to any but the intended recipient, who hears the music instead as speech.  Celestials are playful and mercurial.  Despite this they are quick to anger, turning to lash out with divine wrath.
CELESTIAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The celestial seems to speak to you, its voice pure music.
DEEP_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=deep wizard
DEEP_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a deep wizard
DEEP_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Beneath the gnomes and dwarves there live dark things.  Among the most cunning and fiendish are the deep wizards, a race of creatures that cloak themselves in dwarfskin, and commune with ancient spirits.  They study texts as old as the race of faerie, mastering the dark magics of their forebearers.  Deep wizards have an almost insubstantial appearance.  Their flesh is inky black, and appears hazy in the low light.  Their eyes are the most startling, glowing bright, ranging from red to gold to green.  The voices of deep wizards are little more than a low whisper, murmuring incantations to unleash hell upon the world.
DEEP_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The deep wizard whispers, "Come with me, to dusk and darkness..."
ASTRAL_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=astral horror
ASTRAL_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an astral horror
ASTRAL_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black, spirit-like creatures from higher planes of existence, astral horrors shift between the astral and the physical.  They hover in the air, and superficially resemble featureless people.  Their skin is jet-black, as soft as velvet, and cold as death.  One of the most striking features is their lack of hands.  Their arms taper into jagged, black spikes, which they thrust with incredible force to quickly slay the living.
ASTRAL_HORROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient speech of the astral horror echoes soundlessly in your head.
SHADOW_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow wolf
SHADOW_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow wolf
SHADOW_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wolves corrupted by dark magic, shadow wolves are much larger than the common wolf, with shiny, blue-black fur.  Their teeth and tongue are stained a deep black.

SHADOW_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow wolf howls.
CALLARA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Callara
CALLARA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Callara
CALLARA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Having displayed an unusual aptitude for magic at a young age, Callara was sent by her family to study wizardry in the central lands.  But the masters discovered a young girl with a hard edge and a chilling personality, a child who made blood offerings of small animals to Shiver.  And so they sent her back in shame.  Growing up an outcast, her resentment roiled and thickened.  One day, without a word, she left the community, taking only a curved knife and the clothes on her back.  Wandering the countryside, she brings her black magic to bear on the weak and helpless, retreating back into the wild at the first sign of danger.
CALLARA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Callara's eyes glint with a deep, mid-winter cold.
SHADOW_SNAKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow snake
SHADOW_SNAKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow snake
SHADOW_SNAKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive constrictors that have been tainted by foul magics, shadow snakes are a deep blue-black in colour.  They prefer dark places, where they are nearly invisible, save for their eyes, which are pure milky white in colour.  Shadow snakes coil about their victim, and inject a terrifying poison with their fangs.  It rots the skin, leeching the colour, and causes a hardening that resembles rock.  It is for this reason that shadow snakes are known in some areas as "stone snakes", and hunted ruthlessly.
SHADOW_SNAKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow snake hisses.
FANTASTIC_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fantastic beast
FANTASTIC_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fantastic beast
FANTASTIC_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange, reclusive creature, the fantastic beast has been written about and feared for as long as recorded history.  With the body of a lion, the head of a ram, and the tail of a snake, its appearance is uneven and imposing.  It is intelligent, too, with the capacity to speak and cast old magics.  It can summon the elements, snorting and stamping to call down lightning from the heavens.
FANTASTIC_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fantastic beast sniffs, "And what could you possibly have to say to me?"
SHADOW_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow beast
SHADOW_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow beast
SHADOW_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shadow beasts are the corruption of huge creatures such as rhinoceroses, bears, or lions.  Their hide takes on a deep blue in appearance, almost black, and they attack with unparallelled ferocity.  Their claws and tusks are coated with some foul toxin that causes petrification.  Few wild shadow beasts are known.  They are hunted as they are found; less for trophies as for the safety felt when they are gone.
SHADOW_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow beast bellows in fury.
SHADOW_DEMON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow demon
SHADOW_DEMON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow demon
SHADOW_DEMON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A black demon from the depths of the plains, shadow demons resemble an upright bull with human arms and legs, and have a set of leathery wings.  They have a set of immense, curling horns off the sides of their heads.  With these, they gore and disembowel the living.  They are sent to eviscerate the mortal form to make way for the spirit to follow to the lands of the dead.
SHADOW_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow demon roars with hate.
SHADOW_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wyrms live deep beneath the earth, where they make their lairs in ancient cracks and crevices.  But sometimes, they delve too far, snaking through passageways to a place where ancient magic still sleeps.  Those that do become infused with the magical taint, and grow frighteningly powerful.  Their scales darken; their breath becomes wisps of chaos and darkness.  The wyrms sit on their great hoards, repeating ancient incantations and carving forgotten runes into the chambers and corridors.  In the eternal night of the under-lands, even their minds darken, corrupted more and more until eventually, the wyrm becomes little more than an automaton, controlled by the ancient magic it once discovered.
SHADOW_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow wyrm hisses, "Who are you, who disturbs my slumber?"
SNAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling
SNAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling
SNAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.  The resultant creatures horrified the world: standing nearly as tall as a man, the creatures had the scales and head of an enormous snake, with the remaining features human in appearance.  Cast to the fringes of the world, the snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.
SNAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling spits, "If you will not leave me alone, I will ensure that you do!"
SNAKELING_THUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling thug
SNAKELING_THUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling thug
SNAKELING_THUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakelings have a tough lot in life.  Hideous to the other races, seen as untrustworthy at best, they find true opportunities scarce and fleeting.  Because of this, many turn to simple banditry to survive.  Typically armed with clubs or knives, they prey on passers-by, relieving them of their money and finer possessions.  Snakeling thugs are distrusted even by other bandits; because of this, they tend to work alone, or in small groups of their own kind.
SNAKELING_THUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling thug spits and hisses.
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling sharpshooter
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling sharpshooter
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakelings tend to prefer barbed javelins, but some, when they leave their villages and the surrounding marshes, find the small javelins unwieldy.  Taking jobs with caravans, or as bodyguards, they have found that crossbows, combined with the startling and foreign appearance of the snakeling, provide a suitable combination of accuracy and intimidation.
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling sharpshooter glowers at you.
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling muckraker
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling muckraker
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While some snakelings make their way by thieving or other means, muckrakers take a slyer approach, relying on blackmail and extortion.  Their trade is information, and controlling its flow.  They listen at windows, on rooftops, in alleys; they threaten to expose adultery, treachery, shady business dealings.  For they understand that everyone has their secrets, and to ensure that the secrets are not well-known, they understand as well that everybody has their price.
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling muckraker breaks out into an unsettling smile.
SNAKELING_THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling thief
SNAKELING_THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling thief
SNAKELING_THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Marginalized by the rest of the world, snakelings do whatever it takes to survive: begging, odd jobs, mercenary work.  Many turn to thievery, and indeed they seem to have a natural aptitude for it.  Moving quickly and silently, they enrich themselves through the ivory of others.  Their ruthlessness is fearsome.  Where some would simply filch some coins, it is not uncommon for snakeling thieves to murder their victims to take their rings, bracelets, and even gold teeth.
SNAKELING_THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling thief smiles suddenly, and tenses.
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling assassin
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling assassin
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the other races, the strongest and deadliest typically become warriors or knights, and learn to face their opponents head-on.  But snakelings favour other qualities, and their most dangerous become assassins.  Cloaked in grey or black, snakeling assassins wear daggers and knives all over their bodies.  They move extremely quickly and with deadly grace, stalking their prey unseen until the very moment where they emerge from the shadows, blades in hand.
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling assassin regards you coldly, its face expressionless save for the flickering of its tongue.
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling mercenary
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling mercenary
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakeling mercenaries are known and respected for their no-nonsense approach, and their cold-blooded pursuit of their goals.  They are, however, incredibly mercurial: as their goals change, they act accordingly, and quickly remove those that get in their way.  Snakeling mercenaries typically wear a bit of armour, but not much.  They wish to be able to move and strike quickly, preferring daggers and short swords to the larger weapons favoured by most others.
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling mercenary regards you cooly.
SNAKELING_MAGUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling magus
SNAKELING_MAGUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling magus
SNAKELING_MAGUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Walking the line between wizard and witchling, the snakeling magi wield fearful blood magics.  In exchange for live sacrifices to their dark deities, they are granted tremendous magical powers.  They can call forth massive magical energies, see glimpses of the future, and scry into the past.  Snakeling magi are untrusted and hated by other races, and deeply feared by their own.
SNAKELING_MAGUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling magus' tongue flickers.
SNAKELING_CONJURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling conjurer
SNAKELING_CONJURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling conjurer
SNAKELING_CONJURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The strongest snakelings become assassins; the most clever become conjurers.  As a race, snakelings have a natural aptitude for magic, much more so than goblins or ogres.  Their magical preferences tend towards conjurations both real and imagined.  Skilled at both summonings and illusions, snakeling conjurers tap into what some scholars feel is the natural deception and duplicity of their race.  The skilled conjurer calls forth beings both real and imagined, hiding behind beasts and devils from history and myth.
SNAKELING_CONJURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling conjurer smiles thinly, and says something in a strange, ancient language.
KRAAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kraal
KRAAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kraal
KRAAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The older and stronger of two mercenary brothers, Kraal is an ox of a man.  Standing over seven feet tall, with arms larger than the legs of most men, he has a stupid and dangerous look on his face.  His clothing is in disrepair, needing patches or just replacement, and he wears a tattered suit of chain mail that has seen better days.  But strapped to his back is a massive cleaver of a blade.  An axe with a deep and long blade, it looks almost impossible to wield effectively.  Kraal says very little, speaking more in grunts or motions than actual language, but seems to understand - and enjoy - killing, very well indeed.
KRAAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kraal bellows, his expression that of a wild beast.
MURK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Murk
MURK_DESCRIPTION_SID=Murk
MURK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The younger of two mercenary brothers, Murk contracted a wasting disease during his childhood that caused his left arm to wither and shrivel, hanging useless by his side.  Far smaller than his elder brother, by more than a foot and a half, Murk makes up for his stature in cunning and speed.  His face is a mess of scars.  He wields a small stiletto which ordinarily remains concealed within the folds of his cloak, but which he can draw into his hand within an instant.
MURK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Murk appears to watch you from beneath his cowl.
ALTUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Altus
ALTUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Altus
ALTUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a man, Altus' name and dress place him from the central lands.  His stature seems out of proportion with his looks: though tall and muscular, he still looks every bit a boy.  He wears light blue clothing underneath segmented leather armour, and grips a short stabbing sword in his right hand.  A pair of javelins hang from his back.  His skin is ashen.  His eyes, too, look to be fading.  The culprit appears to be a wound on his arm, just below his pauldrons.  Some sort of scratch or cut, it is encircled by a throbbing, red ring, and oozes a thick, pus-like liquid.
ALTUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Altus grimaces at you, his body clenching with pain.
CORNEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cornel
CORNEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cornel
CORNEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Cornel dresses simply: sturdy wayfarer's clothes, a few small pieces of armour, and a well-worn pair of boots.  Tucked into his belt are a few long throwing knives, and a heavy chain whip.  Attached to the tip is a small sickle.  The man himself is weather-worn, but somewhere just before middle age.  His brown hair falls just past his shoulders; his eyes, a deep blue, are full of pain.  Cornel is dying.  Although he has no visible wounds, the man's skin is pale and grey, and there are flecks of blood around his mouth.  His breathing is ragged and thin.  The pause between breaths lengthens.  He is unlikely to live much longer.
CORNEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cornel looks at you, his spirit sick and dying.
CORNEL_LOCKET_SID=Cornel struggles to speak.  "In my younger days, I went adventuring with a lovely girl - moon-faced, flaxen-haired, plain and beautiful."
CORNEL_LOCKET2_SID="She loved me, that much was clear.  She never said it, but it was evident in the half-glances, the things she'd start to say."
CORNEL_LOCKET3_SID="I never told her how I felt.  It was a failing, of course.  How can I excuse it?  She was so lovely, adventurer, so kind."
CORNEL_LOCKET4_SID="One evening, we built a fire and talked til morning.  There was pain in her eyes; she knew I would never tell her how I felt."
CORNEL_LOCKET5_SID="When I woke, she was gone.  She left this for me.  If you can find her, tell her I always kept this.  Tell her I'm sorry."
CORNEL_LOCKET6_SID=Hacking up blood, convulsing, Cornel passes away.
ZAEDA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Zaeda
ZAEDA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Zaeda
ZAEDA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creator of the Snakelings, venerated by his people as an unliving god, Zaeda paid a terrible price for his dark magic.  Granted near-eternal life by Shiver, he had the Snakelings build him a massive tower at the edge of the world.  Without need of food or drink, he shut himself into the top of the tower, and studied.  With his ever-increasing power, he wrapped the land in a shroud of illusion, bending light around it and making it invisible.  And, all the while, he studied his tomes.  Communing with Shiver, learning ancient rituals, he aged incredibly slowly, but age he did.  His skin began to rot; but, granted endless life, it remained in place, hanging wretchedly on his bones while teeming with worms.  His hair fell out save for a few strands.  And all the while, he studied, looking down on the world from his invisible fortress, plotting the day when he and his creations would march on the world.
ZAEDA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Zaeda catches you with a baleful gaze, his face crawling with worms.
ABOMINATION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=abomination
ABOMINATION_DESCRIPTION_SID=an abomination
ABOMINATION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A hideous demon from the depths of the black plains, the abomination figures in folk-lore and campfire stories, the punishment for wizards who would summon the untamable.  They are unthinking and unfeeling.  Animal-like, they have the body of a bull and four monstrous heads: these vary depending on the creature, and may include goat, man, bear, dragon, or any other creature.  Each of these heads breathes flames, monstrous green-white hellfire that incinerates anything in its path.  It is said that the demon princes keep abominations as pets, and value them deeply, for these monsters are very loyal, very stupid, and very deadly.
ABOMINATION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The abomination's four heads shriek and wail.
FORERUNNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=forerunner
FORERUNNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a forerunner
FORERUNNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The ghost stories of the coastal folk tell of sudden visions, popularly known as forerunners, that foretell some sort of death or tragedy.  The spirits that complete these prophecies are called forerunners as well.  Hazy in appearance, taking no fixed shape, they move quickly, faster than their victims, and kill them with an intense and otherwordly cold.  They come only for certain victims - indeed, the only reason their existence is known is because of the survival of some companions whose demise was not foretold.  It is said that armour is no help against these spirits, and that their icy touch can pierce through even the thickest steel.
FORERUNNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=In the forerunner's murky haze, you see a vision of your coming death.
PLANEWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=planewalker
PLANEWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a planewalker
PLANEWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures not of this earth, planewalkers dwell in a different place entirely, occasionally appearing, as if by chance, in the living world.  They appear to be figures of blazing light.  Their forms shift and shimmer, appearing humanoid one minute, draconic the next.  Little is known about planewalkers save for the intense danger they present.  Attacking with ferocious lightning storms, they are aggressive and volatile, seemingly interested in nothing less than the destruction of all around them.
PLANEWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The planewalker's voice echoes in your mind, its words long, languid, and indecipherable.
STONE_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone worm
STONE_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone worm
STONE_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Stone worms burrow deep within the earth, moving slowly and feeding on innumerable insects.  They live for an incredibly long time, and as the years progress, the tiny worms become larger and larger, with the largest growing twenty to thirty metres long.  They will feed on anything living, digesting bone, flesh, and steel with a powerful acid.  The worms have a reddish-pink tinge.  Stone worms get their name from the strength of their epidermis, which is flexible, thick, and difficult to penetrate.
STONE_WORM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The stone worm rears and circles, acid dripping from its maw.
REDCAP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=redcap
REDCAP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a redcap
REDCAP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Redcaps are little creatures that live in castles and other out-of-the-way places.  Seen by some as demons, others believe them to remnants of the fair folk that once walked the earth.  Redcaps appear as tiny, wizened old men, gaunt, with enormous eyes.  Their clothes are barely better than rags, and they carry little stone blades in their hands.  Their teeth are long and sharp.  Owing to this, their mouths are a mess of blood and gore, and the trail of a redcap is easily found.
REDCAP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The redcap scowls, "Why are you here?  Tell me, or I'll cut it out of you!"
DRAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drakeling
DRAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drakeling
DRAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Known as "fairy wyrms" to some, drakelings represent a distinct evolutionary path from either dragons or wyrms.  Like wyrms, they are serpentine, lacking the legs of a dragon.  But like dragons, they possess functional wings.  Unlike either, they are unable to breathe flame, but emit puffs of acid, instead.  Fairy dragons are about as long as a man is tall, and very nimble.  They dart about on the air, incessantly curious, and quick to anger.
DRAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drakeling warbles and hisses.
ARACHNOS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=arachnos
ARACHNOS_DESCRIPTION_SID=an arachnos
ARACHNOS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A nightmarish demon, the arachnos combines the body of a monstrous spider with the head of an old man or woman.  The name comes from the translation of the ancient Tablet of Names, which inscribed the name in runic script beneath a six-inch carving.  Arachnos lack teeth.  Instead, they spit a powerful acid, which they use to dissolve their victims before feeding on the liquid remains.
ARACHNOS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The arachnos cackles.
BEHEMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=behemoth
BEHEMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a behemoth
BEHEMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=King of the beasts, the behemoth is a monstrous creature even larger than a dragon.  It stands on four legs, and its body is covered with a rough, scaly hide.  A number of horns protrude from its head, and on its feet, it has talons sharp as any raptor.  Behemoths gore and tear and pummel, their fearsome strength lauded in ancient poetry, where anonymous heroes attempt, always unsuccessfully, to slay the beasts.
BEHEMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The behemoth roars!
FLARE_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=flare beast
FLARE_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a flare beast
FLARE_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At the centre of the earth live magical beings crafted of pure flame.  Flare beasts are the dread servants of Voros, creatures of ember and flame, whose appearance shifts so as to appear like a dragon one moment, a titan the next.  They move with ferocious speed.  Their touch is intensely hot, igniting whatever it comes in contact with.  And when they open their enormous jaws, they release a torrent of magma and flame.  It is said that a great and long-dead wizard once tried to bind a flare beast to his will; he was successful, briefly, and then was overpowered, his body reduced to nothing by the white-hot storm of heat.
FLARE_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The flare beast's jaws open, unleashing a rain of fire.
ZEALOT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=zealot
ZEALOT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a zealot
ZEALOT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While all religions have their hard-edged adherents, the dark three take particular joy in cultivating zealots.  These men and women believe, and believe hard.  Not constrained by morality, society, or the rule of law, these people are willing to do anything to serve their deity.  This can include extortion, torture, murder - and worse.  Zealots exhibit a special kind of psychopathy.  For they often take no joy in their heinous acts, only a certain knowledge that their actions are meet and right.
ZEALOT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The zealot says nothing, her eyes hard and cruel.
BLOODLETTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bloodletter
BLOODLETTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bloodletter
BLOODLETTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the adherents of The Trickster, Vedere, and Voros long ago abandoned blood sacrifice, the practice has never left the adherents of Shiver, Urgoth, and Sceadugenga - indeed, those three deities demand it.  And it is believed that as a sacrifice, the blood of the living is far more valuable than that of the dead.  And so sacrifices are brought to these black altars, bound and struggling, and it is the bloodletters who spill their blood on the stones and watch as the struggles slowly cease.
BLOODLETTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bloodletter growls, "Your blood will wet this altar!"
DARK_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dark priest
DARK_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dark priest
DARK_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the black priests of Sceadugenga are marked by the bleeding mark on their forehead, the dark priests of Urgoth and Shiver are no less fearsome.  The pillars of their societies, the priests, in addition to their religious duties, act as judges and arbitrators, and their decisions are always binding.  Few would question them, and none openly, for their anger is quick and harsh, and with a few words they can call down divine power to smite their enemies.  For their life has been spent in servitude, and for this, they are given a dark and terrifying blessing.
DARK_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dark priest's eyes flash with fire.
BELIEVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=believer
BELIEVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a believer
BELIEVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Those who follow the dark three tend to hold stronger to their beliefs than those of the other Nine.  For their beliefs are unwelcome in most places, and they themselves persecuted.  The dark three are seen, right or wrong, as the reason for floods, droughts, and pestilence, and their adherents are often seen as black omens, and treated accordingly.
BELIEVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The believer shouts and sings praises.
DWARF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarf
DWARF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarf
DWARF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarves live deep within mountains, far below the naturally-occurring caverns and caves that serve as the entranceways.  They carve their cities from the rock itself, and mine the mountains for its ore.  They are short, about two-thirds the size of a human, but stocky, and disproportionately strong.  Dwarves are skilled with axes, hammers and crossbows.
DWARF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarf grunts, "Good day to you."
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven metallurgist
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven metallurgist
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarves are noted for their love of gold, and fine metals, and the metallurgist plays an important role in feeding these desires.  It is the metallurgist who works to develop processes to separate metals from the ore, to extract gold or iron or copper from the rock itself.  Due to the intense heats and strange chemicals involved, many dwarven metallurgists are assumed to be completely dotty, and few of them have done anything to dissuade the notion.
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven metallurgist squints at you.
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven stonecarver
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven stonecarver
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In their great underground fortresses, dwarves build massive rooms and halls.  But these are not unadorned.  Adorning them are decorative carvings, statues of ancient heroes, and other works of art.  And it is the job of the stone carver to create these.  Labouring for months, years, or sometimes even decades, they spend their days perched on scaffolding, working with a wide array of tools.  The end result is always beautiful: a work of art that, due to the lack of weather underground, can last tens of thousands of years.
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven stonecarver regards you with bright eyes, her face caked with dust.
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven anklebiter
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven anklebiter
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarven men (and most dwarven women) are warriors of some sort, and their children from a young age learn to emulate them.  The dwarven anklebiter is a dwarf of a particular age, typically no more than three years old.  Barely able to walk, he teeters around wearing a tin pot for a helmet, and carries menacingly a large, leafy tree branch.
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven anklebiter babbles and drools.
DWARVEN_MOTHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven mother
DWARVEN_MOTHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven mother
DWARVEN_MOTHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A common joke among the surface-dwelling races is that the difference between a dwarven man and woman is merely the length of the beard.  But this is unfair: dwarven women do not grow beards at all, and while they tend towards being stockier than human or elven women, they are certainly recognizably feminine.  Dwarven mothers, due to the rambunctiousness of their children, tend to dress in simple linen clothing, easily cleaned.  They are quick to anger, though, and will put their children firmly in their place with a sharp word or a cuff upside the head.
DWARVEN_MOTHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven mother smiles at you broadly.
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven warrior
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven warrior
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarven warriors tend to be stockier than other dwarves.  They also tend to be well-outfitted, wearing fine mail and axes from the dwarven smithies.  Dwarven warriors wear their hair and beards especially long, seeing it as a sign of strength in combat.  They keep these tucked loosely into their armour, so as not to catch or snag.  Dwarven warriors are the vanguard of the dwarven people against goblin and ogre raiding parties, and while the dwarves lack much in stature, they have proven to be more than capable against their foes.
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven warrior grunts, "Tally ho!"
DWARVEN_HERO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven hero
DWARVEN_HERO_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven hero
DWARVEN_HERO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In a race characterized by a brave and bold nature, dwarven heroes stand out for their courage and fortitude.  They wear the finest dwarf-forged armour, their weapons given names in the dwarven tongue.  The veterans of many combats against goblin foes, dwarven heroes have earned the undying respect of their people.  Indeed, their names are spoken in awe over beer and whisky, their deeds recalled over lutes and lyre in the low-sung songs of the scops.
DWARVEN_HERO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven hero grunts a wordless salutation.
PEGASUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pegasus
PEGASUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pegasus
PEGASUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A semi-mythical creature that figures prominently in much ancient poetry, the pegasus is a white, winged horse capable of carrying its rider to the heavens.  Legends tell of heroes who have rode pegasi into battle, and the fear of their foes on seeing the pegasus flying towards them.  Their is much debate into the veracity of these tales; though many have tried to ride the pegasus, none in modern memory have succeeded.
PEGASUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pegasus rears and whinnies.
BOG_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bog devil
BOG_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bog devil
BOG_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In folklore, bog devils are evil spirits who carry away children beneath the marshy waters.  In reality, they are much more terrifying than this.  Resembling a half-eaten corpse, they rise from the fens to stalk the moors.  Their hair is stringy, and missing in clumps; they are often missing fingers, arms, or legs.  They are known to spit a terrible acid, capable of disfiguring their victims, and allowing the devil to feed while its victim writhes in pain.
BOG_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bog devil opens its mouth for a soundless scream.
LEVIATHAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=leviathan
LEVIATHAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a leviathan
LEVIATHAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The leviathan is king of the seas, a massive race of creatures old as time.  They are reptilian in appearance.  Called "sea-dragons" by some, most scholars agree that they are distinct species.  Leviathans live deep in the farthest waters, far from any civilization.  Throughout history, however, there have been tales of leviathans riding in on flood waters, calling lightning from the storm-clouds overhead, leaving death and destruction in their wake.
LEVIATHAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The leviathan roars, and the earth shakes.
SHRINE_HAG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shrine hag
SHRINE_HAG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shrine hag
SHRINE_HAG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The three shrines are full of horrors, but none more terrifying than the creature known as the shrine hag.  An ancient crone bound for eternity to the service of the Nine, she moves with the speed of the greatest warrior, dodging and parrying effortlessly, and attacks with the strength of the mightiest colossus.  Her attacks are like a shapeshifter's: sword and spear, ice and flame, launched with an otherworldly intensity.  For the shrine hags have a singular purpose - to protect the relic, to prevent it from being taken by unworthy hands from the holy place.  They speak in an ancient tongue, older even than the fair folk, before releasing an attack of terrifying hate and fury.
SHRINE_HAG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shrine hag shrieks, "Cativi alaro kvesa!  Alaro rheae!"
ASTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=aster
ASTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an aster
ASTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living stars, to some, celestial demons to others, it is unclear what the beasts called asters actually are.  They do not appear to have a high intelligence, appearing more reactive than anything else.  They streak through the atmosphere, slamming into the earth and causing great devastation.  Emerging from the crater is a rock-like being surrounded by an aura of white-hot heat.  The first of these creatures, and greatest, it is said, found the world when it was young, fighting a great battle against the fair folk, though little else is known.
ASTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The aster crackles and burns with a savage intensity.
DEMON_PRINCE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demon prince
DEMON_PRINCE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demon prince
DEMON_PRINCE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The denizens of the black plains self-organize into a strict hierarchy, the powerful enslaving the weak.  The most powerful of all are the demon princes.  They maintain demonic kingdoms, exerting their massive strength and cunning to bend the plains to their will.  They appear as monstrous humanoids, an amalgamation of many creatures: the head of a dragon, the wings of a griffin, the hooves of a bull.  They are clad in obsidian armour, and wield massive hammers that shimmer with chaos fire.  On their heads are crowns of fine platinum, are they are surrounded by an aura of blinding crimson fire.
DEMON_PRINCE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demon prince howls, "I will make you my slave in the world below!"
KESTREL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kestrel
KESTREL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kestrel
KESTREL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Kestrels are small hunting birds, similar and distantly related to their larger cousins, the falcon.  Kestrels display prominent mottled plumage, and have a sharply hooking beak, which they use to rip and tear at their prey.  Their small size, combined with their natural affinity for people, has meant that kestrels have often been domesticated, serving as quick messaging birds.
KESTREL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kestrel shrieks!
FROSTLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frostling
FROSTLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frostling
FROSTLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the smallest of the monsters, frostlings are the weakest servants of Shiver.  Looking like tiny elves or fae, they measure no more than a finger in height.  Though it is often said that they can fly, they cannot: they are blown in on cold air, and cause all kinds of mischief.  They steal rings and combs, spill wine, bite children, kill pets.  Though they are not always dangerous themselves, they are seen as a bad omen, and it is believed that where frostlings are seen, death and misfortune soon follow.
FROSTLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frostling titters.
SILVER_FISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=silver fish
SILVER_FISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a silver fish
SILVER_FISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Silver fish are the most common fish in the sea.  Their name comes from the silvery sheen of their scales, which at closer glance are flecked with red and black.  Silver fish grow up to two feet in length.  Travelling in great schools, they provide sustenance for the many fishing towns: fresh fish in the summer, salt fish in the winter.
SILVER_FISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The silver fish swims around.
SEAGULL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seagull
SEAGULL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seagull
SEAGULL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Seagulls are seabirds that nest on land and fly out to sea for food, feeding on fish that stray near the surface, and crabs that scuttle the beaches.  White-bodied, flecked with grey, seagulls are voracious eaters and quick to befriend men.  Though their diet is typically fish, seagulls will pick through people's trash for stale bread, meat scraps, and other scavengings.
SEAGULL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seagull sings overhead.
PELICAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pelican
PELICAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pelican
PELICAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Pelicans are large, long birds that feed on fish and build nests near shorelines.  They are instantly recognizable by their long, deep bills, with which they strike the water to catch their food.  Though there are several varieties of the bird, the most common is the white pelican, which have also been seen engraved surviving shards of ancient pottery, symbols of significance for some ancient and forgotten culture.
PELICAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pelican squawks!
JELLYFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=jellyfish
JELLYFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a jellyfish
JELLYFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Jellyfish are marine animals made up of a gelatinous substance.  They consist of two parts: a large, bell-like structure that can expand and contract for locomotion; and many thin, stinging tentacles.  The tentacles are their means of hunting.  Able to penetrate skin and even scales, they inject powerful venoms into the jellyfish's victim.  Fortunately, jellyfish are not quick creatures; without a strong current present, most will be able to simply swim away.
JELLYFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The jellyfish twists and turns, its tendrils sweeping the water.
SEAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seal
SEAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seal
SEAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Seals are mammals that spend a great deal of their life at sea.  They spend much of their time deep in the water, but come ashore to mate and rest.  They are carnivorous, feeding on the many species of saltwater fish, and have shown a propensity for tameness, gathering around fishing villages and port towns to feed on the discarded portions at scaling stations.  Seals range in size from the tiny blue seal, which grows roughly to the size of a small dog, to the massive dragon seal, found in the frigid northern waters, which is often mistaken in the dark by sailors for a small whale.
SEAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seal barks.
SWORDFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=swordfish
SWORDFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a swordfish
SWORDFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Swordfish are large fish, and though they prefer warmer waters, they can be found throughout the world.  They grow more than six feet in length, and have a long, sword-like bill.  Swordfish use this to slash and cut, weakening their prey before catching and eating it.  Due to this excellent evolutionary weapon, they have few predators - the larger species of sharks are known to attack swordfish, along with the great octopi and jellyfish, but little else can stand up to them.
SWORDFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The swordfish parries and thrusts.
MERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=merman
MERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a merman
MERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Merfolk are an ancient race, one that myth says were created just after the elves, and made to roam the seas the way the elves roamed the land.  Mermen have the upper bodies of men, and the lower bodies of fish.  They are strong, and exceptionally brave in combat.  Mermen are typically armed with spears, tridents, and glaives, and armoured with bucklers and breastplates.
MERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The merman glances at you haughtily.
ELECTRIC_EEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=electric eel
ELECTRIC_EEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an electric eel
ELECTRIC_EEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient order of fish, electric eels resemble snakes, having a distinct lack of fins.  They tend to live in shallow water, as they actually breathe air, and must therefore return to the surface periodically to breathe.  Their electrical charge gives them a unique place within the ecosystem - though they are small enough to be eaten by a number of larger creaures, their electrical shock can be used effectively to counter that.  And so they are able to feed effectively, also using their charge to shock their prey, effectively disabling it prior to attacking.
ELECTRIC_EEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The electric eel swims around.
SQUID_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=squid
SQUID_DESCRIPTION_SID=a squid
SQUID_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Squids are cephalopods, having a distinct, elongated head, and eight tentacles.  Squid use these tentacles to grab their prey, holding it in place while they tear at it with their teeth.  Squid also have an effective self-defense mechanism: they are able to discharge a cloud of heavy ink, which distracts their predator, allowing the squid to retreat to deeper waters.
SQUID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The squid releases a puff of ink.
MERMAID_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mermaid
MERMAID_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mermaid
MERMAID_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Female merfolk are called mermaids: half woman, half fish, they have long enchanted sailors who have glimpsed them from their boats.  Little is known about mermaids, other than that they appear to enjoy human company, and attempt to entice men to join them in their homes beneath the water.  These men, captivated by the mermaids' beauty and nudity, last scant minutes before they drown.
MERMAID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mermaid sings, "Come swim with me!"
GIANT_CRAB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant crab
GIANT_CRAB_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant crab
GIANT_CRAB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Giant crabs are are underwater arthropods that grow immensely large in size.  They are typically speckled red and white, though orange and even purple have been observed.  In some well-known older specimens, the legs have been measured to be more than seven feet in length.  Despite these massive legs, the body itself does not typically grow very large.  Because of this, the crab has less weight to support, and is quite nimble, able to move quickly and strike with incredible force using its claws.
GIANT_CRAB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant crab scuttles towards you.
GREY_OCTOPUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=octopus
GREY_OCTOPUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=an octopus
GREY_OCTOPUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Related to the squid, the grey octopus is a cephalapod that inhabits a diverse range of areas: shallow and deep waters; warm, central seas and frigid arctic oceans.  It is also quite dangerous, having a powerful, wasting venom.  The grey octopus attacks by encirclement, catching its prey in its tentacles and using its beak to tear into its prey, injecting its venom.  The grey octopus usually feeds on shellfish, and among its few natural predators are the larger species of shark.
GREY_OCTOPUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The octopus glides by, its tentacles curling as it passes.
BLACKFIN_SHARK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackfin shark
BLACKFIN_SHARK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackfin shark
BLACKFIN_SHARK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Of the many species of shark, the blackfin is the smallest, but most savage.  Growing to about four feet in length, these sharks are distinguished by their dark silver scales and black fins.  Despite their small size, they are very aggressive, attacking creatures many times their size.  They often attack in groups.  When they work together, they have been known to take down even the great whales of the southern seas, feasting on the massive carcasses and gorging before moving on.
BLACKFIN_SHARK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blackfin shark glides by, silver and black, a shadow in the water.
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wraith jellyfish
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wraith jelly fish
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The so-called "black death of the seas", the wraith jellyfish is uncommonly large and deadly.  It takes its name from its stuttering phospholuminesence: normally, it moves about in total darkness, but generates flickers of light, allowing it to appear only for short bursts, usually less than a second.  This flickering process lends it a ghostly impression.  Unlike most other jellyfish, the wraith jellyfish does not attack with powerful toxins.  Instead, it is able to store up electrical charges throughout its body, releasing massive electrical shocks into whatever touches it.
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wraith jellyfish floats past you, flickering with an eerie light.
LANTERNFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lanternfish
LANTERNFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lanternfish
LANTERNFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange, deep-sea creature, the lanternfish is a massive carnivore with a rather strange feature.  It has a large antenna, bulbous at the tip, that lights up in darkness.  The lanternfish uses this to both seek out and lure prey, moving it about to resemble small prey fish.  Once it has closed with its prey, the lanternfish tears into it with many rows of sharp, hooked teeth.  Ultimately, what makes the lanternfish so dangerous is its size: growing ten feet in length, it is close in size to the larger sharks of the oceans.
LANTERNFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lanternfish glows with an unearthly light.
SIREN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=siren
SIREN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a siren
SIREN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sailors have long known that the months and years at sea cause a man to see strange things.  But throughout recorded history, there have been sightings of beautiful and beguiling women far out at sea.  They sit upon rocks, playing the lyre, singing wordless, spellbinding songs.  These women are called sirens, and their song is enchanting, especially to men who have not had the comfort of a woman in so long.  It is said that the pull of their music can cause a man to jump overboard and swim towards them - but the sirens never seem to get any closer, and the sailor swims til exhaustion, his body claimed by the waves.
SIREN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The siren begins to sing, her voice pure and enchanting.
STONE_WHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone whale
STONE_WHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone whale
STONE_WHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the smallest species of whale, the stone whale takes its name from the mottled grey appearance of its skin.  Stone whales grow to about thirty feet in length, and while not naturally aggressive, will defend themselves if startled.  Their tail is quick and powerful, capable of smashing through the hull of most ships, and can also be used to capsize smaller vessels.  Stone whales eat plankton and small crustaceans, and can dive to great depths in to escape from their predators.
STONE_WHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The stone whale releases a massive burst of water from its spout.
SEADRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seadragon
SEADRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seadragon
SEADRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Despite its name, the seadragon is actually a massive and ancient species of fish, growing twenty feet or more in length.  With an almost reptilian appearance and a fierce, aggressive nature, it took the name "seadragon" from the first fisher-folk.  This name has persisted, in some form or another, throughout history.  The seadragon is a deep-sea creature that occasionally rises higher in the ocean to hunt.  It moves quickly, and is known to prefer squid and octopus, which it can outpace, and jellyfish, to which it appears immune.
SEADRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seadragon opens its mouth, revealing rows and rows of teeth.
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mammoth turtle
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mammoth turtle
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mammoth turtles are thought to be a relic of days gone by, not nearly as numerous as the smaller, fragile, and more common turtles common throughout the world.  They can grow to many thousands of pounds, dwarfing men and even giants.  Though turtles lack gills, the mammoth turtle is an aquatic variety of turtle, and is known to swim the deep, swift ocean currents.  This allows them to travel quickly between far-flung parts of the world, and arrive back annually to their nesting grounds.  Though mammoth turtles are not instinctively hostile, they are quick to rile when approached, perhaps a more modern reaction to the peoples who use their flesh for soups and shells for jewellry and armour.
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mammoth turtle regards you with narrowed eyes.
WATER_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=water elemental
WATER_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a water elemental
WATER_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elementals are mindless servants of the Nine, formed and directed by divine will.  Water elementals appear as a massive torrent emerging from river or sea, stretching from the depths to the heavens.  They are capable of great destruction, capsizing or even destroying ships, and sending men to their death below.  Legends tell of ships that have sailed too far to the edge of the world; as punishment, the Nine sent elementals to rend the ships and slay the sailors.  The legends are less clear on how this was recorded, if, by divine will, there were to be no survivors.  Water elementals are believed to be used by Shiver and Vedere.
WATER_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The water elemental spins about you, a massive torrent, its roar deafening.
GREAT_EEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=great eel
GREAT_EEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a great eel
GREAT_EEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Great eels are a species of eel that can grow sixty feet or longer.  Nearly sightless, but patient, they swim about, waiting for a suitable meal.  Their scales are a dark green, an almost slime-like colour, and their teeth have an awful, yellowish hue.  They typically feed on large fish and crustaceans, though they are large enough and blind enough that when they catch men swimming in the water, they are unlikely to make the distinction.
GREAT_EEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The great eel slithers by.
WATER_DEMON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=water demon
WATER_DEMON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a water demon
WATER_DEMON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most denizens of the black plains are air-breathers, appearing on land in the mortal realm to sway travellers, tempt the righteous, and otherwise upset the world of men.  But there are some demons that swim the great icy seas.  These water demons appear to be the inhuman hybrid of man and reptile - they have the torso and limbs of a man, but with webbed fingers and toes, and a horrific reptilian head.  Water demons breathe a blast of icy water that slows their victims, allowing the demons to catch their prey and drag it down into the huge methane seas of the plains.
WATER_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The water demon whispers something in a bubbling, demonic tongue.
LION_SHARK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lion shark
LION_SHARK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lion shark
LION_SHARK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lion shark is the largest of the shark species.  It is named for a black ring on its scales that encircles its body, just behind the gills, resembling the look of a lion's mane.  Perhaps ironically named, the lion shark is a species that does not travel or work together; instead, they hunt alone, and are fiercely protective of their kills.  However, like the lions they are named for, lion sharks are fierce and very dangerous.  They are not afraid to attack swimmers near coastlines, and it is for this reason that they are hunted by many of the fisher-peoples.  Because of this, the population of lion sharks has been declining along coastlines, though it is reported that they are still common in the open ocean.
LION_SHARK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lion shark bares its teeth.
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=earth elemental
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an earth elemental
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Servants of the Nine, and thought to be used by Urgoth and Sceadugenga, earth elementals appear as a shambling, giant-like form made entirely of stone.  Though somewhat slow moving, perhaps owing to their immense mass, these elementals are incredibly powerful, able to smash stone and steel.  They are unthinking and unspeaking, controlled by force of divine will, and do not rest until their purpose has been completed.
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The earth elemental steps towards you, the ground trembling beneath it.
ROOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rook
ROOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rook
ROOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rook belongs to the same family of birds as crows and ravens, and its distinguished from its cousins by the white of its beak.  A social bird, rooks typically hunt and nest in groups, and are quick to defend any companions that may be threatened.
ROOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rook caws.
BLUE_JAY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blue jay
BLUE_JAY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blue jay
BLUE_JAY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, vivid bird, the blue jay has bright blue plumage, with a white belly.  They feed on insects, seeds, and nuts, loving hazelnuts particularly, which they hide away for the long winter months.  They are noisy birds, but their song is not particularly beautiful, and they are often seen as a nuisance due to their thievery.
BLUE_JAY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blue jay chirps.
SHRIKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shrike
SHRIKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shrike
SHRIKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shrikes are a predatory bird, small, but dangerous.  They are fond of grasping their victims in their talons and impaling it on whatever they can find: brambles, sharp branches, and nearby rocks being the most common.  When their victim is too large to be moved, the shrike will instead attack ferociously, diving in and out quickly, attempting to bleed out its victim before feeding on the carcass.
SHRIKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shrike chirps.
FALCON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=falcon
FALCON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a falcon
FALCON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Falcons are large hunting birds, intelligent raptors that typically feed on small mammals.  Falcons have also shown a trainability that has long made them a favourite among the nobility, who enjoy them as a symbol of status and wealth, and train them to hunt upon command.
FALCON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The falcon shrieks!
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mountain elves are the first elves.  When the world was young, they made their settlements high in the mountains.  At some point, there was a migration into the world below, and these become the wood elves, but many chose to stay up in the peaks.  Mountain elves are tough and hardy, dressing in hides and furs, and fight with clubs, hammers, and slings rather than sword and bow.  They are less free-spirited but more wise than their woodland cousins, and have a deep love of learning.  
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf nods at you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elves share a common curiosity.  Wood elves enjoy crafting, the fae practice elder magics, and the mountain elves satisfy their curiosity through exploration.  Their villages are built into mountains, but still low enough that there is plenty of air.  Mountain elf explorers dress in fur coats made from bear and sheep, and climb the highest peaks, carving their names as they reach the summits.  They are extremely able climbers, climbing with little equipment save for a tent, sleeping roll, and a few other necessities.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf explorer exclaims, "Watch your step!"
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf spelunker
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf spelunker
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While most mountain elves are content to stay nearby their villages, or climb high above them, there are some whose curiosity drives them beneath the mountains themselves.  Armed with ropes and picks, they shimmy through the caverns and caves, mapping out the massive underground structures.  But this is a dangerous passion: many of the maps bear names such as "Ilvyn's Folly", or "The Drop of Bones".
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf spelunker grunts at you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf stonemason
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf stonemason
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mountain elves are well known for the quality of their stonework: massive fortresses, sturdy houses, and elegant carved inlays.  Mountain elf stonemasons build these structures and often do the artistic touches as well; it is expected that a good stonemason be able to contribute to all parts of the project.  Their hands tend to be incredibly hard and worn, and many walk with a limp or hunch from many years of hard labour.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf stonemason watches you closely.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf topographer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf topographer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While most races have no problems producing excellent, basic maps, it is agreed that the mountain elves excel at producing topographical maps.  Perhaps owing to their location high in mountains, mountain elf topographers, working with explorers, are able to produce incredibly precise maps showing height and terrain features.  These are valued by kings and commanders for showing excellent positions for fortifications and battles.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf topographer hails you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf vanguard
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf vanguard
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Despite their positions and fortifications high in the mountains, the mountain elves often find themselves under long siege from goblins and ogres.  In response to this, they have started to send a vanguard down to seek out raiders, skirmish, and retreat.  Those selected are chosen for their braveness, speed, and ability to make quick decisions.  Skirmishers wear very light armour, typically just layers of skins and leather, and carry only a hammer, club, or mace - enough to sneak in, crack some skulls, and then melt away.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf vanguard flashes you an ugly, toothless smile.
QUAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quakeling
QUAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quakeling
QUAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living deeper than troglodytes, gnomes, and dwarves, the quakelings are deeply feared by each.  They lope slowly through underground caverns, squeeze themselves through crevices, and come to the upper world to hunt.  The size of a large bull, their bodies are hugely muscular, and their faces underdeveloped.  Perhaps due to the lack of light, their eyes are little more than tiny slits, but their huge jaws show rows of large, sharp teeth.  As they lope, the earth shakes noticably, and it is this quality of their terrifying movement that gives them their name.
QUAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quakeling stamps its feet, and the earth shakes.
WOOD_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf
WOOD_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf
WOOD_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood Elves retreated into the forests millennia ago, building their civilizations in the treetops and branches.  Within the woods, they blend in with their surroundings, their clothing dyed deep shades of green and brown.  Wood Elves are skilled archers, and are known for their devotion to swordsmanship.
WOOD_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf says, "It is a beautiful day, is it not?"
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood elves do not have the ready access to ore that other races, such as dwarves, gnomes, or even humans do.  They set up small mines, and when they do find deposits, guard them carefully.  With the ore, they create swords of incredible function and beauty.  Some elves, captivated by this beauty, dedicate their lives to swordsmanship, carrying little more than a blade and the clothes on their back.  These swordsman are revered by the elves, and feared by outsiders, for they form the small and elite core of the elven armies.
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf swordsman looks at you distrustfully.
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf moneychanger
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf moneychanger
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though ivory is accepted all over the world, there are many currencies local to particular regions, from silver pieces to iron guilders to (in one case) aesthetically pleasing antelope skulls.  Moneychangers maintain a supply of the more important local currencies, and allow the conversion of one to another, at a particular rate, for a particular fee.  Many moneychangers are wood elves simply due to their distance from the world: many perceive wood elves to be the most fair, because they live so far apart from most other societies.  Wood elf moneychangers typically wear loose robes, their currencies hidden within in many tiny pockets, and often carry a small sword or rod for protection.
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf moneychanger nods almost imperceptibly.
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf bowyer
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf bowyer
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Two of the most important roles in any elven village is that of the bowyers and fletchers.  Responsible for the creation of the bows and arrows that are so central to elven culture, these men and women take care in selecting the right tree, planting and tending to a new one to replace it, and then making the most use of the wood.  A great many of the bows are made from yew, hickory, or ash, depending on what is available nearby.  In addition to providing bows locally, many elven bowyers have found their skills in demand elsewhere, with elven bows being a symbol of pride and prestige throughout the rest of the world.
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf bowyer shakes your hand, his grasp uncommonly strong.
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf forester
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf forester
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Foresters play an important role among the elves.  They act as unofficial sentries and watchmen, keeping an eye on comings and goings even as they fell dead trees, clear and mark paths, and keep the underbrush tidy.  They often live in the wild for the entire summer, or even longer, returning only after the first snows make forest life inhospitable and cold.
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf forester regards you wordlessly.
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf child
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf child
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood elf children have a great curiosity, part of the reason they are so adept at magic.  By the time they become adults, this has hardened into a distrust for the world beyond their borders, but the children remain keen and curious, excellent students but also prone to wandering to the fringes of the woods.  They appear slightly smaller than a human of the same age, but far slimmer, and move with much more grace.
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf child laughs, "You must be an adventurer!  I can tell by your mismatched armour and ugly face!"
ILRU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Leader of the Yew Wood Elves, Ilru has seen hundreds of summers pass in the old forest.  A proud man entering into old age, Ilru's long red hair is streaked with grey, his face testament to his years.  He wears a rough green shirt and a leather cape, and tucks a simple knife into his belt.
ILRU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ilru nods at you.  "Welcome, traveller.  This is the Forest of Yew."
FALIR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young wood-elf dressed in a loose grey robe, Falir looks much older than his years.  His voice has withered to a whisper; he walks slowly, with purpose; and an ugly purple scar runs from his forehead down to his ear.  His green eyes are cat-like and piercing in the low light.  Falir clutches a twisted wooden staff between his hands.
FALIR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Falir speaks in a soft tone.  "You have done well to find us here.  This forest is very deep and deceptive."
LALO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in fine armour beneath a dark green cloak, clutching a glowing white spear, Lalo watches keenly from beneath his cowl.  A wood elf with dark red hair and nut-brown skin, Lalo's face is harsh and pale.  His eyes are steel-grey and unblinking, and his lips form a thin frown; his veins bulge against impossibly thin skin.  Underneath the fine mail, Lalo's movements are quick and precise, and his voice conveys a keen intelligence and authority.
LALO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lalo murmurs, "You will make a suitable slave in the next life."
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Perhaps owing to their long life and natural curiosity, wood elves with a talent for magic rarely limit themselves to a single subject.  Equally capable as wizards, oracles, and pilgrims, many choose the long road of the sage, spending many years acquiring a broad depth of knowledge.  They spend their days inside, reading.  Their nights are spent in candlelight, hunched over ancient texts and in prayer to the Nine.  They are much frailer in appearance than other elves, taking little food and wine, and often are particularly gaunt in appearance.
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf sage says, "Knowledge is geography - it must be charted for future generations."
WOOD_ELF_SENTRY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf sentry
WOOD_ELF_SENTRY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf sentry
WOOD_ELF_SENTRY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is a myth that elves are all slender, lithe beings, dressed in simple clothes, clutching knobby, wooden staves.  Owing to the savage nature of the world, they post sentries along their islands to watch for raiding ships.  These sentries dress in plated mail, and carry bardiches and heavy swords.  They inhabit watch forts of various types, which range from simple lean-tos to elaborate, walled forts.  Understanding the stresses that solitude places on their sentries, the wood elves keep a strict, four-year term before watchmen are retired to work other roles within elven society.
WOOD_ELF_SENTRY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf sentry says, "Yes, I saw the Roan-folk.  Their ships came by a few years ago, sailing toward the central lands."
LICHLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lichling
LICHLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lichling
LICHLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sages speak of black sorceries practiced long ago, magics that could raise the dead from their rest.  Some students have tried to study this magic.  Most become mad, wandering the world, speaking of black devils, sea-demons, tendrils in the night.  But some, a few, are able to force their way into this realm.  These magi become filled with unnatural powers, able to command the darkness and foul creatures, able to fell the living and raise the dead with but a word.  The initiates are called lichlings, and live somewhere between life and death.  Gaunt and grey, their flesh festers with open sores, and their teeth are full of rot.  Their hair takes on a putrid brown-grey appearance, and their movements become slow and arthritic.  But beneath their robes, their eyes burn, their minds becoming slowly corrupted by the powers they unlocked.
LICHLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lichling hisses, and you can smell decay in its breath.
GREY_GLIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The grey gliders are the recently dead who have been infused with spells of life and lifting.  The magic drains all colour from them: from their skin, their death shrouds, and any possessions.  This process makes them a startling dark grey in appearance.  As well, grey gliders do not walk.  Their magic grants them the ability to glide inches above the ground, allowing them to silently stalk their victims before delivering the fatal bite with their sharpened teeth.
GREY_GLIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The grey glider's lips twist back into an ugly smile.
GHOUL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghoul
GHOUL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghoul
GHOUL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ghouls are animated corpses.  Raised by more powerful magic than the thrall, ghouls are quick and nimble, much faster than they appear.  Instead of fingers, they have talon-like claws, and unlike the thrall, ghouls are nearly silent.  The black magic robs them of their voices.  They are often seen with their mouths open in a silent scream, the only sound being a slow, quiet hiss.
GHOUL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghoul releases a hiss of fetid air.
CORPSE_BIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Corpse birds come from the same family as crows and ravens.  They are smaller than crows, though their talons are larger, and their beaks longer.  Their eyes have a strange red rim about them.  Though corpse birds are social, and often seen in groups, it is when they are seen alone that people are most troubled.  Many have passed down stories in which the sudden appearance of a corpse bird, and its cackle-like laugh, have foreshadowed a sudden death.
CORPSE_BIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse bird caws.
QUISLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quisling
QUISLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quisling
QUISLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Treacherous, lesser demons from the black plains, quislings superficially resemble men and women.  On closer inspection, they have two key differences: they have a ram's legs rather than a humands, and nubby horns at the edge of their forehead.  To hide their appearance and walk among men, they wrap themselves in long, hooded cloaks.  They do not wear boots, however, and the sign of hooves or the tell-tale sound they make is quick to betray them.  Quislings speak in soft, assuring tones, purporting to help people before turning on them in a vicious rage to drag their souls into the world below.
QUISLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quisling smiles, "I see a great future for you, adventurer.  A glittering career."
KIRIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kirin
KIRIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kirin
KIRIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mountain elves value skill in battle and strong leadership over bloodlines.  Because of this, Kirin's ascension to rule was swift.  He fought as a foot soldier against ogre invaders, loosing boulders and skirmishing on the narrow mountain paths.  His skill with the unwieldy stone club became well-known, and he was soon commanding a small band of elves that held off a force ten times their size.  After the ogres were driven to the sea and destroyed, he became leader of Atua-Elar, showing good judgement and wisdom during the ensuing years of peace.
KIRIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kirin says, "Welcome to the mountains, adventurer.  This is the village of Atua-Elar."
AKKARA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akkara
AKKARA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akkara
AKKARA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Akkara is a young woman, at least by elven standards; tall for her race, with light brown hair and green eyes.  She wears simple linen clothing underneath a blue-grey shawl.  Despite her simple appearance, her expression is quick, and piercing; a brilliant student, Akkara learned how to read and write very early.  Once she mastered the elven language, she taught herself geography, mathematics, and wizardry in the stone carrels of the old library.  After leaving for a time to study in the great central cities, she returned, full of knowledge, bringing with her a cart full of texts.  Once settled, she was made librarian and headmistress, spending her days teaching the children, and her evenings reading by candlelight.
AKKARA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Akkara smiles. "Welcome to the library of Atua-Elar!  This is the history room."
TWILLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Twille
TWILLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Twille
TWILLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Twille wears simple elven clothing: cotton, earth-toned, a little loose, as if he has lost a fair amount of weight since they were made.  And he is certainly thin.  Middle-aged, his red-and-grey hair drawn back into a long ponytail, he has the look of one who has spent a long life reading.  For warmth he wears an old, brown overcoat, lined with pockets.  These are stuffed with all manner of things.  White swan-quills erupt in threes or fours, sharing space with scroll cases and scraps of blotting paper.  Small bulges within suggest ink pots, or perhaps sealing wax.
TWILLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Twille says softly, "This has been my life - here in this library, in the carrels, one book after another, poetry and history and prose."
TWILLE_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="My classmates grew up, grew older.  Found lovers.  Had children.  But our choices necessarily mean that we all leave something behind."
TWILLE_SPEECH3_TEXT_SID="I have known emperors and kings, priests, peasant poets.  Empires come and gone.  Greatness by reference; words in the dark."
THESILEA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thesilea
THESILEA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thesilea
THESILEA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A slight, bookish girl, Thesilea is uncommonly smart, even by elven standards.  She excelled in school, focusing on history, rhetoric, and poetry.  Her days were spent in the library, where it was quickly discovered that she possessed immaculate and accurate penmanship.  Holed up in a carrel in the library's scriptorium, she copied many ancient and decaying works, preserving them on new vellum for the generations to come.  Her skill at this led to her employment as chief scribe, where she not only copies works, but manages the day-to-day operation of the scriptorium and its half-dozen scribes and illuminators.
THESILEA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Thesilea looks at you nervously, shrinking under your attention.  "Ink?  Do you have a few inkpots you could trade?"
THESILEA_TRADE_SINGLE_SID=Thesilea barely meets your eyes.  "We need ink.  Um, real badly.  I can trade you a blank scroll for, uh, three inkpots if that's okay."
THESILEA_TRADE_MULTIPLE_SID=Thesilea murmurs, "Lots of ink?  Okay, we can trade.  A scroll for every three.  How many scrolls do you need?" 
THESILEA_TRADE_BAD_NUMBER_SID=Thesilea looks at her feet.  "That, uh, doesn't work.  You're kind of bad at math."
THESILEA_TRADE_NO_DEAL_SID="Okay," she says sadly.  "Okay."
THESILEA_NONSENSE_SID=Thesilea stares at you.  "Do you...eat paste?"
THESILEA_TRADE_COMPLETE_SID=Thesilea quickly makes the trade.  "Come back again," she stammers happily.  "We're always low on ink."
ILIRI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Iliri
ILIRI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Iliri
ILIRI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Middle aged, gaunt, with high cheekbones and a stern expression, Iliri acts as one of the scribes of the library of Atua-Elar.  Borrowing books from passing scholars, he works late into the night making copies for the library's collection.  A scholarly man, Iliri's interests tend towards the arcane, and he has built up the library's collection of magical works over the course of many decades.
ILIRI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Iliri whispers, "This is the room of secrets, home to our small collection of arcane manuscripts."
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf scholar
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf scholar
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=From a young age, the wood elves train in swordsmanship and archery.  Mountain elves, too, train for combat, but they also ensure academic training, and the learned are held in the same esteem as the mighty.  The scholars spend their days reading old texts, practicing their penmanship, and developing their ideas about geometry, history, and literature.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf scholar looks up from his book.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf youth
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf youth
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While mountain elves spend the early parts of their days in school, learning literacy, history, and other subjects, the rest of the day they are expected to spend drilling fighting, helping out their households, and other such tasks.  In practice, this is not always the case.  Many youths spend this time exploring the mountains, hunting goat and horned sheep, and spelunking.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf youth grins.  "Want to come goat hunting?"
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf brewer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf brewer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the mountains, the summers are cool, the winters desperately cold.  The mountain elves warm themselves with furs and peat fires, but also with copious amounts of spirits.  They prefer gin, harvesting the berries of the juniper, and using this in combination with herbs and flowers to flavour the alchol.  Mead is also popular, though honey is scarce, so it is made less often.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf brewer asks, "Care to try a sample?  There are taps on the barrels!"
TIR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tir
TIR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tir
TIR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When mountain elves feel the pull of adventure, typically they move up or inward, exploring peaks and caves.  But there are some who take their chances with the outside world.  Tir is a young man, dressed in wool and wolf-skins, a short spear and a backpack slung across his back.  He looks particularly weather-beaten: his dark red hair is long, almost waist-length, dry and cracked from the wind; his face is a map of scars; and he seems to have chipped several teeth.  Despite this, he appears to be in remarkably good spirits, his eyes twinkling, his mouth caught in an unconscious smile.
TIR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Tir says, "I've just come back from the far west, from the edge of the world.  I found an island full of ogres; I crept in by night, and saw something."
TIR_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="It was an amulet of some sort, a thing of great beauty.  It is too beautiful for ogre-folk; I wonder whose it is?"
AKOJO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akojo
AKOJO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akojo
AKOJO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Captain of a raiding party, Akojo is a slight goblin.  Smaller than his kinfolk, he nevertheless lean and muscled.  He refuses heavy armour, preferring to wear a simple leather jerkin and wristguards, and a jagged, curved sword hangs from his waist.  Unlike other goblins, who rise in rank by physical strength and brutality, Akojo became a captain through guile, cunning, and stealth.  His raiding parties are always successful; his ship, The Black Shadow, never lacks for crew.
AKOJO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Akojo glares at you from a face awash with scars.
COUGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cougar
COUGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cougar
COUGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large breed of cat, the cougar is smaller than other cats such as the tiger or lion, but larger than the lynx.  Cougars are wide-spread, living in forests, grasslands, and mountains.  Cougars feed on whatever mammals they can find: rabbit, fox, deer, even wild horses and rams.  Their fur ranges from light to dark brown, and a full-grown adult can grow to be more than two hundred pounds.  Cougars are known to be aggressive towards people, particularly when hungry.
COUGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cougar emits a strange sound, somewhere between a whine and growl.
MAWGRAWL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mawgrawl
MAWGRAWL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mawgrawl
MAWGRAWL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mawgrawls are hideous, primeval creatures from the early days of the world.  Resembling massive worms, they grow sixty feet or more, with a diameter that can exceed six feet.  Their flesh is a dull greenish-grey, and their maws drip with a powerful acid.  Mawgrawls dissolve and then engulf their prey, absorbing their nutrients before burrowing back into the earth.
MAWGRAWL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mawgrawl rears up and sways.
QUEEN_BEE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=queen bee
QUEEN_BEE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a queen bee
QUEEN_BEE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In normal bee colonies, the queen bee is not particularly dangerous or aggressive, but for larger varieties of bees, the queen bee's diet of royal jelly causes her to not only to become the largest in the colony, but also the most aggressive and volatile.  These queens leave the hive, and will attack anything that crosses their path.  Unlike the worker bees, whose stingers become detached when used, the queen bee's remains firmly in place, allowing her to attack repeatedly with her potent and deadly poison.
QUEEN_BEE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The queen bee buzzes angrily.
LION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lion
LION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lion
LION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the largest of the great cats, lions prowl the grasslands and savannahs, the prey of no beast.  Lions live in groups called prides, and hunt the great roaming herds of large mammals, culling the young, the sick, and the elderly.  Growing to hundreds of pounds, lions' claws are capable of slicing through small trees, their massive jaws capable of biting through mail.  Lions are a symbol of power and strength, and figure prominently in the heraldry of the royal houses.
LION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lion roars.
CAVE_TIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The largest member of the cat family, cave tigers prowl the caves and caverns of the mountainsides, occasionally coming down to the fields and forests when times are lean.  Usually a foot higher than a lion, and several feet longer, cave tigers' colouring matches their natural habitat.  Their fur is a sandy brown, offering a degree of camouflage in mountain settings.  Perhaps their most startling feature is their jaws: two massive fangs extend from their upper jaw beyond the lower, providing them a terrifying way with which to gore, main, and kill their prey.
CAVE_TIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave tiger roars.
LIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=liger
LIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a liger
LIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A hybrid of lion and tiger, bred for its ability with magic, the liger closely resembles a lion with a tiger's colouring.  Something in the breeding process centuries ago awoke something: a low sentience, perhaps, and one that was strangely attuned to the primordial energies of the world.  As a result, ligers attack with the ferocity of a beast, but with the arcane energies of a sorceror.  Ligers are greatly prized among wizards; if tamed, the beasts are considered among the greatest of familiars.
LIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The liger whines, a high-pitched, siren-like sound.
GOLIATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goliath
GOLIATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goliath
GOLIATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Towering above the cyclopes, the colossi, and even the heavenly titans, the goliaths are massive creatures from before recorded time.  They sleep underneath mountains, deep in caverns - anywhere where they can find rest.  It is said they were among the first creations on the world, and it was through their footsteps that the world took shape.  Goliaths are so tall that they can into the heavens to throw lightning, smiting their foes before retreating back to their rest.
GOLIATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goliath's speech rumbles like thunder in a long-forgotten tongue.
SEA_SERPENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sea serpent
SEA_SERPENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sea serpent
SEA_SERPENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Distant (and, some think, early) relations to dragons, the sea serpents are massive beasts that live deep within underground caves and caverns.  Monstrous creatures that grow hundreds of feet in length, they rise to hunt shark, and whale - and ship.  Stories have been told how, in the dead of night, a sea serpent has coiled around the hull of great wooden ships, smashing the decks with its head eating the men below.  The serpents are said to breathe destruction, like dragons, though instead of fire, their breath is frost and ice.
SEA_SERPENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sea serpent raises its head to the heavens and releases an unearthly roar.
NICOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nicor
NICOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nicor
NICOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An enormous sea-monster, the nicor has the body of a great reptile, and five monstrous heads.  It patrols the depths, using its limbs and tails to swim quickly; these resemble long, broad flippers.  Ancient poems have written about this creature as the guardian of a great undersea evil, the cavern inhabited by the mother of a great monster.  The nicor is wrathful, a beast of pure hate and destruction: its heads spew flame and ice and vile poisons, and it fights with such ferocity that none can stand in its way.
NICOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nicor's five heads gnash and roar.
WHITE_WHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=white whale
WHITE_WHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a white whale
WHITE_WHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There are many species of whale throughout the world, but the largest is the white whale.  Despite its massive size, the white whale eats mainly plankton and crustaceans, ignoring the many species of fish that thrive in the cold waters.  Growing more than a hundred feet long, it is known to prefer the frigid waters of the far north and south.  It is prized by the skraelings that live nearby - its skin is used for clothing, its blubber an important food and heating source, and its bones used to create arrows, spears, and other tools.
WHITE_WHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The white whale swims past.
BUNYIP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bunyip
BUNYIP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bunyip
BUNYIP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In hushed tones, the aboriginal peoples speak of a great creature, a monster that lives in marshes and rivers, in shallow sea-beds.  This beast is called a bunyip, and no two descriptions of it are the same: some say it has scales, some fur, and some say the skin is hairless.  But it is agreed that the creature is fearsome and fearless, snatching great beasts in its jaws and dragging them down to the waters below.
BUNYIP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bunyip hisses softly, the sound like gas coming off a marsh.
KRAKEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kraken
KRAKEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kraken
KRAKEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sailors whisper of a creature found deep beneath the waves, a massive, octopus-like creature so huge it is said to have torn ships apart, and clasped a dozen men with a single tentacle.  The name given to this beast is "kraken".  Scholars have long discussed this creature, and included it within their bestiaries, but the lack of firsthand accounts remains troubling - despite the protestations of the sailors who claim to have witnessed it, it is agreed by the scholars involved that the word of sailors is not worth a great deal.
KRAKEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kraken flails its tentacles high in the air, and blots out the sun.
DEMOGORGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Demogorgons are primordial spirits, immortal and incredibly powerful.  They travel at will not just through the world, but through time and space as well.  Many a man has been seduced by the supposed secrets whispered in his ear by these ancient creatures, told of ancient magics and future discoveries, driven mad by the unrealizable torrent of knowledge.  When demogorgons take physical form, they appear as massive, multi-headed beasts, each head whispering truths and falsehoods.  As they are immortal, they cannot be killed; when their physical form perishes, it releases the spirit, which travels away before reforming again.
DEMOGORGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demogorgon's voice echoes soundlessly in your head.
RED_WITCH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=red witch
RED_WITCH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a red witch
RED_WITCH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Transdimensional beings from another world, red witches possess a strange magic that allows them to shift between numerical dimensions.  When they exist in three dimensions, they appear as beautiful and naked women, scarlet-skinned, with roiling, ebony eyes.  They can use their powers to become atom-thin, slipping under doors; or thinner, working like snakes through the molecules of solid rock.  Their voices are haunting and musical, and when they speak, it is heard but briefly.
RED_WITCH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The red witch locks her eyes on you.
SOLARIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=solarian
SOLARIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a solarian
SOLARIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The magical transformation of solar flares into living form, solarians are cast off from stars to make their home within the centre of hot, unstable worlds.  Lumbering and giant-like, they crawl and shamble, uncurling their bodies to stand at hundreds of feet tall.  Their dark skin is veined with glowing, white cracks - these periodically erupt, causing the solarians to be sheathed in an intense and blinding heat.  Their faces are featureless - no eyes, no mouth.  They perceive the world some other way, perhaps telepathically.  They attack with enormous columns of stone, and are fearsomely strong, triggering earthquakes and landslides, disfiguring the earth with every crushing blow.
SOLARIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The solarian erupts in flame.
HELLBEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hellbeast
HELLBEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hellbeast
HELLBEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange, extraterrestrial creature, the hellbeast is almost feline in appearance.  Long-legged, with massive paws, its body is thick and muscular, covered with a short coat of mottled, yellow-red hair.  It moves with a startling quickness.  Its presence is easily known: a stench follows it, caused by its breath, heavy and laced with sulfur.  Deeply unstable, the gas constantly ignites, giving the impression that the creature breathes bursts of flame.
HELLBEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hellbeast throws back its head and roars.
INFERNAL_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=infernal wyrm
INFERNAL_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=an infernal wyrm
INFERNAL_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Whether ancestor or distant relation to the dragon and the wyrm is unclear, but it is certain that the infernal wyrm is the greatest, the most powerful, and the most cunning.  Growing to a thousand feet in length, their bodies are covered with scales that pulse with heat and light.  They are fearsomely intelligent.  Infernal wyrms can not only speak, but communicate telepathically; read Old Runic, and all the modern languages; and understand far more than is written down or heard.  While dragons and lesser wyrms hoard gold and baubles, infernal wyrm gather knowledge, magics, accumulating vast stores of power for an ultimate purpose known only to their black minds.
INFERNAL_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The infernal wyrm's eyes blaze with unholy fury.
LAVOS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lavos
LAVOS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lavos
LAVOS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange creature found at the world's centre, the lavos is formed entirely of molten lava.  The lava shifts and swirls, taking all manner of shapes - first, a dragon; then, a titan, or a roc, or a kraken.  Lavei are little more than legend, unseen in recorded history, with the few accounts speaking of a slow flow of magma forming deep in underground caverns, the temperature slowly rising, until suddenly, explosively, the creature emerges.
LAVOS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lavos drips with liquid flame.
NETHER_HYDRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nether hydra
NETHER_HYDRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nether hydra
NETHER_HYDRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Beneath the deepest oceans, within the cracks and fissures, live strange beasts the likes of which the surface world have never seen.  Nether hydras resemble their surface kin superficially - many-headed, with a vaguely draconian appearance, their blue-black scales shimmer darkly in the light.  But their bodies are covered by spines of various sizes, and their feet are webbed, the better for movement on water or land.  Their bite is treacherously cold, and their mouths drip heavily with a fearsome toxin.  It overwhelms their victims, slowing them while killing them from the inside, making fast work of those who would stand against the lords of the deep.
NETHER_HYDRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nether hydra releases a terrifying roar!
SEA_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sea worm
SEA_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sea worm
SEA_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At the bottom of the sea lives a creature whose adaptability is terrifying.  Able to breathe air as well as water, the sea worm grows to enormous lengths.  With few predators at their natural depth, they feed on plankton and skittering undersea insects, and over many years take on their huge and terrifying form.  Many are sixty feet or longer, with shiny, segmented bodies and a massive, flaring mouth full of hooks and spines.  Sea worms move slowly, and their acidic bile, if it does not kill outright, can induce a powerful paralysis.
SEA_WORM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sea worm slowly rears up.
MESOSAUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mesosaur
MESOSAUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mesosaur
MESOSAUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Within the shallow seas, the mesosaur rules over all else.  Its webbed feet let it move easily in water or land, and it can breathe either air or water.  Its reptilian body is covered with rows of squat spikes, and underneath, its hide is thick as any dragon's.  It has a long and flexible tail, which it flicks about dextrously; at the tip is a fearsome fist of spines and quills.  Its head is elongated, with an extended stout.  The look is something like that of a crocodile, with the same base, animalistic cunning.  Because of its size, the mesosaur is always hungry, always hunting, looking for anything it can to slake its thirst for blood.
MESOSAUR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mesosaur shrieks, the awful sound building to a shrill crescendo.
GHOST_RAY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghost ray
GHOST_RAY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghost ray
GHOST_RAY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Translucent and sleek, the ghost ray is able to move quickly and silently.  There is a soft glow about it, an internal light - the ghost ray acts as a deep-sea battery, accumulating an electrical charge as it swims about the deep.  Ghost rays deliver this charge by the hair-like needles on their tail.  Capable of delivering a powerful blast of electricity, they use this to paralyze or kill their prey.  Then, after death, as the victim is stripped of flesh and muscle tissue by other creatures, the ghost ray swoops in to feed on the remains.  
GHOST_RAY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghost ray swoops and turns in the water.
MEGALODON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=megalodon
MEGALODON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a megalodon
MEGALODON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A beast quite unlike anything recorded history has ever seen, the megalodon is a shark-like creature capable of growing a hundred feet in length.  But it is distinguished from other sharks by its heads - two of them.  While individually mutated sharks, either natural or through magics, have been found before, the megalodon species is naturally bicephalous.  Its heads are fully independent, though one is naturally dominant, slightly larger and in control of movement.  The lumbering beasts swim slowly, but are capable of bursts of great speed, gliding softly through the water and then accelerating to tear apart their meal.
MEGALODON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The megalodon fixes you with a cold, dead stare.
EKAKOPHIA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ekakophia
EKAKOPHIA_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ekakophia
EKAKOPHIA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature whose name has no meaning in any culture, the ekakophia is a monstrous hybrid of man, insect, and animal.  Though its body roughly resembles that of a wild beast, having a long torso covered in short, roan-coloured hair, its eight legs are distinctly arachnid.  Its head is strangely human - bald, but toothless, with a pair of fangs for tearing - and at its rear, a long, menacing tail.  Tipped with a wicked barb, this delivers a powerful poison that causes slow petrification, and the ekakophia makes its presence known by the half-eaten statues left in its wake.
EKAKOPHIA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ekakophia releases a long and hateful whine.
MYRIADON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=myriadon
MYRIADON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a myriadon
MYRIADON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A monstrous creature, the myriadon stands large as a dragon.  But built like a bull, its thick head seems firmly set against its body, its neck almost non-existent.  Perhaps the reason for this is its jaw?  The closest analogy is a crocodile, though that's insufficient, the snout being longer, the bite-strength terrifying, the teeth more numerous.  The myriadon combines its forceful strength and massive jaws to tear apart flesh and bone, shred steel, and crumble rock.
MYRIADON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The myriadon growls slowly.
LAMIA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lamia
LAMIA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lamia
LAMIA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Half woman, half snake, the lamia closely resembles the naga in appearance.  But while the naga is a mute demon, the lamia is more insidious, strikingly beautiful, and possessing a honey-sweet voice.  Lamia use this to charm and bedevil, slithering closer, closer, and finally wrapping around the helpless victim, frantically tearing at the chest to expose and devour the heart.
LAMIA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lamia smiles, and slithers closer.
MOLOCH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=moloch
MOLOCH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a moloch
MOLOCH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Greatest of the demons of the black plains, molochs are slow and silent, mountainous, standing hundreds of feet high.  They wear a demonic armour made of some unknown metal: a foot thick, the plates smoulder with blue-black demonfire, with a heavy, visored helmet to cover the face.  Despite their stature and terrifying presence, molochs are mute.  But the ground trembles as they walk, and shatters under the force of their massive, gauntleted blows.
TITANIC_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=titanic slime
TITANIC_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a titanic slime
TITANIC_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing at first as a small lake, translucent and shimmering, the titanic slime lures by deception.  Rising up, it can envelop the largest creatures: behemoths and leviathans, dragons and wyrms, able to encase its victims in a murderous sludge.  This acid breaks down rock, eats blood and steel and bone, leaving only precious metals behind.  Throughout history, some great hoards have been found deep in caverns, utterly abandoned, and it's thought that these may be the result of the titanic slime, having simply enveloped the dragon, absorbing it before moving on.
COPPER_BIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=copper bird
COPPER_BIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a copper bird
COPPER_BIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A thing of myth, mentioned in passing in a single source - the tale of Tel and Floridel - copper birds are beings of pure magic, glittering and sparkling, incredibly fast, birds in shape but having the sheen of the finest copper.  Their song is so high, it can barely be heard.  Their movements are quick and precise, but belie their mercurial nature: carefree one moment, they can turn in an instant, releasing a debilitating, piercing charge.
COPPER_BIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The copper bird chirps happily.
BIRD_OF_PARADISE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bird of paradise
BIRD_OF_PARADISE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bird of paradise
BIRD_OF_PARADISE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The modern bird of paradise, a brilliant, rainbow-plumed bird, shares little in common with its ancient and forgotten ancestor.  Sharing the same long, curving feathers, the ancient bird of paradise brims with primordial magics.  Its colours roll and shift; it attacks with fire and cold, magic and poison.  Its song is musical, melodious, and flocks of birds will play off each other, working their birdsong into counterpoint, shifting from consonance to dissonance, resolving with strange, unearthly chords.
BIRD_OF_PARADISE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bird of paradise does a mid-air pirouette.
ALGHARI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=alghari
ALGHARI_DESCRIPTION_SID=an alghari
ALGHARI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The alghari is a fearsome spirit, a lovely woman who comes at night; who rises out of the earth, filthy, wormy, covered with mold.  Though human in appearance, she glides effortlessly, inches above the earth: pulls at windows, slips through cracks in the wall; kills cats and dogs, suffocates children, pulling them down through the floor; works her way into bedrooms, under sheets, her eyes gleaming, her mouth dripping with blood.  Silent in her arrival, she sings a strange song as she leaves, a raspy soprano heard faintly as her victims' bodies are found.
ALGHARI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The alghari presses her mouth against yours, and you can feel a slow trickle of blood building in your throat.
NOXIOUS_PLUME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=noxious plume
NOXIOUS_PLUME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a noxious plume
NOXIOUS_PLUME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Feeding off free gases and powerful magics, noxious plumes raise high above the earth in a massive, swirling cloud.  Seen from above, they look like a giant, unblinking eye, crackling with lightning and flame, surrounded by a halo of heat and gas.  It is thought that they are the result of wild magics, miscast spells; the physical embodiment of hubris and pride.  Uncontrollable, living off chaos and magical feedback, they billow up miles into the air, choking the life out of everything they consume.
DEMIGOD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demigod
DEMIGOD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demigod
DEMIGOD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Nine have always been static.  Never more, never less, their number has remained constant for as long as recorded time.  But they have some very human needs, and there have long been whispers about great heroes who, lacking a mother or a father, grow into abilities far beyond mortal means.  These demigods are not officially recognized by the teachings of any of the Nine, but their powers are thought to be immense: flight, super-strength, the ability to lead armies and raze cities almost single-handedly.  It is thought that there have been many throughout history - that the Dragon Lords were Shiver's progeny, for example, or that many of the high wizards were the offspring of Celeste herself.
DEMIGOD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demigod blazes with divine fury.
CELESTE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Celeste
CELESTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Celeste
CELESTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=First, there was Celeste.  Empress of the Heavens, the Creator of All Things, she created the universe from nothing but her sheer force of will.  She made the stars and galaxies, the planets, and the vast, empty space.  And when this was done, she created seven other beings, to dwell with her, in and above the cosmos, beyond the trivialities of living things.  Celeste is known to all people, for all cultures have some theory of creation.  Even if her name may differ from place to place, the stories are the same - of a divine force that made all things, that raised the heavens, that gave the basic breath of life.  The skraelings of the northern islands call her Iksha, she-beneath-the-waves, believing her to live in the abyssal caverns. The nomads who walk the upland moors name her as Telos, an old word not of their own language, which loosely translates as "end" or "goal", perhaps naming what she has done.  But most other folk know her as Celeste, the name given to her during the time of the ancient empires, and as much as the divine can speak, it is said that she approves.
CELESTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Celeste blazes with an intense and speechless fury.
AURELION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Aurelion
AURELION_DESCRIPTION_SID=Aurelion
AURELION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=And then Celeste created Aurelion from iron and star-fire and steel, a being of impossible strength and honour.  His sword could cleave the earth.  It is said that in ancient time, beyond all written history, the land was a single, massive continent; that Aurelion, driven to rage, brought his hammer down from the heavens and shattered the earth, creating the islands, atolls, and archipelagos.  He is worshipped by good-hearted folk as a deity of valour, gallantry, and honourable combat.  Ancient people sacrificed fatted calves and sheep the night before battle, both as a display of wealth, but also of piety.  His image is common on the pottery of the ancient ages, a great, armoured knight wielding a massive, curved blade. 
AURELION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Aurelion raises his hammer high above his head; you realize that the potters got it wrong.
THE_LADY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Lady
THE_LADY_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Lady
THE_LADY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID= A divine creature of immeasurable beauty and goodness, The Lady took Aurelion as her lover.  In mortal form, she appears as pure light, though the most pious have said that she appears to them directly as a young woman of impossible beauty.  She has been reported with black hair, red hair, grey eyes, green eyes; and she carries a small flute, from which she plays sweet and haunting melodies.  Certainly of the three good and noble deities, she figures least prominently in the histories - Aurelion and Celeste represent a kind of righteousness and power to which many civilizations aspire.  But The Lady has always had a small number of worshippers, often simple folk such as peasants or shepherds.  She provides a kind of basic joy and happiness, and her devotees claim a closeness to the divine which the other deities do not provide.
THE_LADY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Lady's beauty transfixes you.
VEDERE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vedere
VEDERE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vedere
VEDERE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To put life on the rocky world, Celeste took stone and water and nascent air and made herself another creator.  Vedere was his name.  Bringing him into being, Celeste taught him how to create and name things.  He made oceans and land, birds and insects, all manner of life.  He breathed life into everything by speaking its true name.  He taught the tall grass to sway, and the mantis to strike.  He taught fish to swim, and then to leave water to live on land.  He made the first inhabitants of the world, those whose names are lost but known to him.  He made the fair folk, giants, unlings; later, elves and dwarves, gnomes, goblins and ogres, man.  Though bound to neutrality, Vedere most frequently sides with the side of good, as it is said that Celeste granted a large portion of her own being when she created him. 
VEDERE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Vedere watches you wordlessly, clutching a long, cypress staff.
VOROS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Voros
VOROS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Voros
VOROS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A massive wyrm, a world-snake whose anger shakes the earth.  Though Vedere created the initial placement of the world, Voros enacts change through his wrath, raising mountains and erupting volcanos.  Living deep within the world, Voros sits apart from the rest of the divine, rarely speaking, rarely taking sides, content to watch the way things unfold.  His strength is apocalyptic: tens of thousands of feet long, it is said he could reach from the earth and touch the moons in the heavens.  His scales are said to glow a deep crimson, as if he is made from magma himself, and his eyes are a deep and unsettling yellow.  Throughout history, people have long associated him with dragon-kind.  Wyrms are made in his image, of course, and it is believed that his worship peaked during the historical period known as the Dragon Age.
VOROS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Voros coils, his scales glowing, preparing to erupt.
THE_TRICKSTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Trickster
THE_TRICKSTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=The Trickster
THE_TRICKSTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An agent of unpredictable change, a creature woven from probability and unpredictability who would walk the earth, causing strange and unexplainable events.  She made him appear as a normal man, though cloaked.  She granted him a companion, plucking a raven from a mountain ash and granting it immortality.  And then, she set him loose.  He wanders the plains and forests, crosses the oceans on his back with his raven on his chest.  And everywhere he goes, there are strange, unexplainable events.  It is said that he makes buildings collapse, or lovers meet; that empires have fallen at his whim, and that others have formed in his wake.  He was named by the tribes of the western plains as the Trickster, after he passed through their camp and a birthing buffalo produced a pure white calf.  As this story spread, so did his name, and this divine being has been known as the Trickster since.
THE_TRICKSTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Trickster hovers, supported by a pair of massive crow's wings.
SHIVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shiver
SHIVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shiver
SHIVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Celeste then created two beings from the empty void of space.  First, from the vacuum's inexorable cold she created a being of winter, of dark magic, of killing and keening.  This creature, appearing in human form as a bent crone, is the goddess known as Shiver.  Believed to be the most cunning of the Nine, she connives and schemes, taking interest in some living things and seeking the fall of others.  She brings early frosts, killing crops; calls blizzards to kill livestock and children; delights in hardship and toil.  But to her worshippers, Shiver grants great secrets.  In exchange for blood sacrifice, she imparts ancient powers, teaching arcana that was lost when the world was young.
SHIVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Shiver calls to you from beneath her cowl, her voice soft and flattering, calling you closer.
URGOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgoth
URGOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgoth
URGOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=If Shiver represents a cold cunning, her ally embodies catastrophic strength.  Formed of dark matter, the being known as Urgoth was made by Celeste as a counter-balance to Aurelion.  Seen in earthly form as a massive shadow, taller than the highest mountain, Urgoth commands a terrifying horde of evil beasts: hydras and chimeras, goblins and ogres, nicors and bunyips.  Throughout living history, he has brought terrors to fight the creatures of good rallied by Aurelion.  And if Aurelion loves honourable combat and valour, Urgoth enjoys little more than wanton killing, maiming, and gore.  He delights in torment.  His temples contain the dismembered and dessicated corpses of the sacrificed, who themselves are prisoners captured in battle.  And he demands the same cruel qualities in his initiates, who seek to sow chaos and destruction on a grand scale.
URGOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Urgoth rushes towards you, his club raised high.
SCEADUGENGA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Sceadugenga
SCEADUGENGA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Sceadugenga
SCEADUGENGA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Celeste made only seven: eight gods and goddesses, including her, but they are unerringly referred to as the Nine.  The ninth was not made by her, but is something else entirely.  A beast that existed before the universe, and that shall surely last beyond.  Pure blackness, pure evil, a force so terrible that the others imprisoned it in a place beyond the universe, in another reality altogether.  Sceadugenga: a word from the Wolf Age, it means shadow-walker, light-eater.  Though trapped in its unreality, parts of it poke and probe at the edges, testing its prison, manifesting briefly in the physical realm.   These appear as masses of tendrils that writhe like a million snakes, and  attack with such force as to raze entire islands.  Sceadugenga attracts the most cruel and nihilistic creatures, those who seek the wholesale destruction of all things.  Its servants can be identified by an ugly black mark on their foreheads, a rune that pulses and bleeds, naming them as servants of the black god.
SCEADUGENGA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Emerging from a tear in the universe's fabric, Sceadugenga approaches.
CRYSTALLINE_BEING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=crystalline being
CRYSTALLINE_BEING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a crystalline being
CRYSTALLINE_BEING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Byproducts of the process that forms stars and planets, crystalline beings are made equally of mineral and magic.  They form strange, shifting patterns, their bodies cut with intricate patterns, glittering in the light.  Their movements are slow and deliberate.  Hovering inches above the ground, they move almost imperceptibly; but when threatened, propel themselves faster than thought, the air behind them alight with tiny particles of hazy crystal dust.  They are said to be among the highest heavenly creatures, servants of Celeste herself.  She finds their form pleasing, their unquestioning servitude meet and right.
SERAPH_HIGHEST_HEAVENLY_ORDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seraph of the highest heavenly order
SERAPH_HIGHEST_HEAVENLY_ORDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seraph of the highest heavenly order
SERAPH_HIGHEST_HEAVENLY_ORDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The first angelic servants created by Celeste, seraphs of the highest heavenly order are deceptive in their form.  Looking as normal men and women, they invariably have long, shimmering hair, and behind their backs they fold a massive pair of feathery wings.  Despite this appearance, they are fearsome - wielding swords forged by Aurelion himself, their loose and verdant robes woven harder than steel.  Appearing before generations of holy men and women, the seraphs have learned common speech.  Their voices are lilting, perfectly enunciated, their speech littered with strange words that perhaps fell out of usage.  Trusted by Celeste for her greatest tasks, it is said that the sight of them is reserved for the greatest and the lowest alike.
SERAPH_HIGHEST_HEAVENLY_ORDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="Glory to Celeste, and blessed her word!"  The seraph of the highest heavenly order lifts up its sword.
GABAR_CLUTCHING_FIRST_HOLY_BOOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gabar clutching the first holy book
GABAR_CLUTCHING_FIRST_HOLY_BOOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gabar clutching the first holy book
GABAR_CLUTCHING_FIRST_HOLY_BOOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In one of the old tongues, "gabar" translates loosely as strong, or mighty.  The gibborim are heavenly beings who ascended when they gained perfect understanding of the first divine book, those secrets whispered by Celeste and The Lady in the early days of existence.  They are dichotomous in their appearance: either tall, perfect-featured, almost otherworldly; while others look very much like some early form of man, a reflection of the young world when Elysians shared the ancient forests with other, unnamed beings.  When a gabar gained complete and total understanding of that early text, he or she ascended to the stars, clutching close the book, the mind ablaze with audacious heavenly secrets too sweet to tell.
GABAR_CLUTCHING_FIRST_HOLY_BOOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A gabar clutching the first holy book carefully turns a page, and begins to chant.
KNIGHT_EXEMPLAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=knight exemplar
KNIGHT_EXEMPLAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a knight exemplar
KNIGHT_EXEMPLAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Magical beings of no physical form, knights exemplar are spirits who exemplify the virtues stressed in Aurelion's teachings.  As they have no physical being, they inhabit fine suits of armour crafted by Aurelion's favourite smiths.  Throughout history, Aurelion has used these spirits to guide the most promising knights and paladins.  Valorous, chivalrous, and honourable, knights exemplar teach through their actions, granting Aurelion's followers a greater understanding of his holy principles.  Once Aurelion is satisfied with the student's progress, the spirit disappears, leaving the acolyte with a shining suit of armour to ward away the dark.
KNIGHT_EXEMPLAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The knight exemplar readies its shining blade.
PARAGON_TWENTY_VIRTUES_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=paragon of the twenty virtues
PARAGON_TWENTY_VIRTUES_DESCRIPTION_SID=a paragon of the twenty virtues
PARAGON_TWENTY_VIRTUES_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Virtuous men and women have long lived by a number of core tenets: honesty, valour, justice, and humility, among others.  But these are just a subset of the virtues preached by Aurelion, eons ago.  Among the less popular virtues are temperance, abstinence, modesty, and a number of others that run contrary to peoples' basic instincts.  Those who master the twenty virtues ascend to serve Aurelion himself, but such servants are few.  In the early world, a small cohort emerged, and just a few figures have joined since.  For Shiver and Urgoth find strength in the sins of man: in greed and lust, in hate, and the wants we keep within.
PARAGON_TWENTY_VIRTUES_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The paragon of the twenty virtues looks at you coldly, and you feel somehow wanting.
TRIO_SHINING_SILVER_DRAGONS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=trio of shining silver dragons
TRIO_SHINING_SILVER_DRAGONS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a trio of shining silver dragons
TRIO_SHINING_SILVER_DRAGONS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dragons are traditionally associated with Voros, the great wyrm.  But contrary to cliche and myth, not all dragons are greedy, or full of base desires.  Some balance their terrifying ferocity with honour and valour, tempering their worst urges to form a strange moral code, something still animal, but recognizable, from a distance, as almost good.  And from these, Aurelion selects the greatest.  Forming them into flights of three, he uses them as terrifying shock troops, granting them celestial powers and the gift of unending life.
TRIO_SHINING_SILVER_DRAGONS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The trio of shining silver dragons maneuvers around you, attempting to cut off your escape.
HOWLING_FURY_FIRST_LOVE_LOST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=howling fury of first love lost
HOWLING_FURY_FIRST_LOVE_LOST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a howling fury of first love lost
HOWLING_FURY_FIRST_LOVE_LOST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Embodiment of the grief of a first love unrealized, the howling furies are wrathful avengers of The Lady.  The antithesis to her serene nature, they are sent by her to punish the most wicked and prideful.  Looking roughly like young women, the furies bleed profusely and endlessly from a series of self-inflicted wounds.  Their faces are shredded and torn, the skin peeling, hanging loose in long strips.  Their arms and legs are covered in small cuts, each the size of a fingernail, pulsing and oozing with blood.  Their divine, shining robes stain quickly, soaking and drying to maroon before magically turning to white once more, an endless cycle punctured by shrieks of loss and anguished rage.
HOWLING_FURY_FIRST_LOVE_LOST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The howling fury of first love lost turns towards you, and crouches, her face a seeping wound.
LUMINOUS_ANGEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=luminous angel
LUMINOUS_ANGEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a luminous angel
LUMINOUS_ANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most angels are either mortal beings, ascended; or else divine creatures made of celestial dust and wind by Celeste's own hand.  But the luminous angels who serve The Lady are different - beings of the purest energy and light, who by magic and divine will can assume forms seemingly at will, shimmering, shifting.  Their base appearance is an amorphous gleam of coloured light that, as it approaches, changes and brightens.  Tapping into the minds of those nearby, the light slides into familiar and comforting forms: a parent long since passed, a childhood pet, a lover left too soon.  In this way, the luminous angels create an association with those they visit, that The Lady and her servants are merely vessels for undying love.
LUMINOUS_ANGEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The luminous angel looks at you, smiles, and begins to sing.
SAINT_WHO_MOVES_IN_PERFECT_GRACE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=saint who moves in perfect grace
SAINT_WHO_MOVES_IN_PERFECT_GRACE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a saint who moves in perfect grace
SAINT_WHO_MOVES_IN_PERFECT_GRACE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While other deities' dictums are exhaustive or proscrpitive, The Lady's are simple: live a life of humility and love.  Among those that follow her tenets, many are blessed by moments of her presence, and a small few are touched by her divine hand, to ascend to the heavens on pegasi of light and sound.  Called saints by most, these are the words for the holy men and women of Aurelion and Celeste, who are blessed but separate.  The Lady considers her divine followers to be her companions, and wherever they travel, through the cosmos or in the physical world, she is always nearby.
SAINT_WHO_MOVES_IN_PERFECT_GRACE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The saint who moves in perfect grace raises her hand to make some sort of holy sign.
PULSATING_MASS_PRIMORDIAL_OOZE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pulsating mass of primordial ooze
PULSATING_MASS_PRIMORDIAL_OOZE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pulsating mass of primordial ooze
PULSATING_MASS_PRIMORDIAL_OOZE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Forming from the liquified remains of dying worlds, primordial oozes absorb not just the matter but the magic, pulsating with a tempestuous and raging light.  These cosmic creatures are so large they can rise to cover the sky, blotting out sunlight - and their touch is pure poison, full of toxins from distant worlds.  Unlike many slimes and jellies, which often have degrees of translucence, pulsating masses of primordial ooze are opaque, a mesmerizing greenish blue that shifts in and out of turquoise, cerulean, jade.  Wholly made of recycled planet matter, they are the mindless servants of Vedere.
PULSATING_MASS_PRIMORDIAL_OOZE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pulsating mass of primordial ooze wibbles threateningly.
CLOUD_MURDEROUS_FLESH_EATING_SCARABS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cloud of murderous, flesh-eating scarabs
CLOUD_MURDEROUS_FLESH_EATING_SCARABS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cloud of murderous, flesh-eating scarabs
CLOUD_MURDEROUS_FLESH_EATING_SCARABS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The scarab, that shimmering, thick-shelled beetle found all throughout the world, has long been a captivating thing, appearing in ancient art, buried with priests and emperors.  Most members of the scarab family are necrophages, feeding on dead and decaying organic matter, whether plant or animal.  But for a small number of these species, there was at some point in the past an evolutionary flip.  These insects are happy to attack living flesh as well, forming massive swarms to savagely chew the flesh and muscle off their victims, boring into organs, a vicious and particularly terrifying way to die.
CLOUD_MURDEROUS_FLESH_EATING_SCARABS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cloud of scarabs buzzes and swarms.
THUNDERBIRD_LOW_STEPPES_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thunderbird of the low steppes
THUNDERBIRD_LOW_STEPPES_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thunderbird of the low steppes
THUNDERBIRD_LOW_STEPPES_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The nomadic, wagon-pulling peoples of the low steppes are an ancient group, living in isolation from the rest of the world.  For millennia, they have eked an existence out of their plains, growing grains and settling down when it suits them, and otherwise following the herds of aurochs that are their favourite food.  As a group, they are thought to be one of the oldest intact peoples of the human race, and for this reason, their myths and legends are of interest to scholars and folklorists.  One of their legends tells of a massive creature, a thunderbird, that is said to fly above the world and bring apocalyptic storms.  Tawny-feathered, it is depicted in their pottery and weavings as having black wingtips and startling eyes, and they say that its voice is in no way birdlike, but instead, a steady, insistent drum.
THUNDERBIRD_LOW_STEPPES_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thunderbird opens its beak, releasing a strange, droning drum.
HUNDRED_HEADED_HYDRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hundred-headed hydra
HUNDRED_HEADED_HYDRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hundred-headed hydra
HUNDRED_HEADED_HYDRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the greatest monsters ever to live, the hundred-headed hydra had only a brief existence in the world, never figuring into recorded history - but as the shock troops of Voros, they are sustained by divine manna, and live in the deep cosmos.  Covered in pale blue scales, their heads dip and writhe like a mass of snakes - and unlike the modern hydra, which is somewhat draconian in appearance, these hydras look far more reptilian.  Their unblinking snake-eyes remain fixed forward, and a forked tongue flickers outside the mouth.  They possess an incredibly potent neurotoxin, injected from their thick, curving fangs, and slither slowly via a massive, serpentine body.
HUNDRED_HEADED_HYDRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hundred-headed hydra hisses!
DRAKKHAR_CARRYING_MASSIVE_FLAMING_SWORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drakkhar carrying a massive, flaming sword
DRAKKHAR_CARRYING_MASSIVE_FLAMING_SWORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drakkhar carrying a massive, flaming sword
DRAKKHAR_CARRYING_MASSIVE_FLAMING_SWORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The official scriptures state that the world is created, and will exist eternally.  This comfortable cosmological theory is by and large accepted by most religious scholars, who place their trust in the work of sages who muse, disconnected, on the nature of being.  But some claim otherwise.  A few prophets of the great wyrm, driven mad by their divine communion, claim that the world will end in fire - that when the sun begins to fade, and the stars die out, the drakkharim who sleep beneath the earth will rise; that they will put what people remain to the sword; and with their massive, flaming blades, they will cleave apart the earth, bringing to a close the days of a cooling, dying world.
DRAKKHAR_CARRYING_MASSIVE_FLAMING_SWORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drakkhar raises its sword towards you, never breaking your gaze.
EARLY_DRAGON_FIRST_AGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=early dragon of the first age
EARLY_DRAGON_FIRST_AGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an early dragon of the first age
EARLY_DRAGON_FIRST_AGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The early dragons were nothing like the ones who remain.  The four-winged ancestors flew faster, and were more nimble.  Any one of these would have elevated a Dragon Lord above his peers - assuming he could impose his will in the first place.  The breath of these dragons, shaped by early magics, shifted quickly, from fire to ice, from lightning to cutting wind.  Their scales, too, showed a startling range.  Not just red and green, but cyan and purple, silver, copper, and gold.  And unlike so many creatures of myth, traces of these dragons still remain.  Buried deep within the shale, under many layers of soil and rock, scales from these beasts are still unearthed, radiating deep and ancient magics, harder than any other material known.
EARLY_DRAGON_FIRST_AGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The early dragon of the first age roars!
EDDIC_CRONE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=eddic crone
EDDIC_CRONE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an eddic crone
EDDIC_CRONE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Agents of stark and unpredictable change, the eddas of a lost group of seafaring peoples described a strange, three-eyed crone.  Moving softly, shuffling and humming, she appears bent and haggard, though her gaze could crumble stone.  Her outer eyes, in their normal placement, look cloudy and unfocused, while the third eye, set higher, in the centre of the forehead, looks unblinkingly forward.  These crones appear suddenly: seemingly from thin air, behind a door, beneath the bed, breathing heavily, waiting.  It's said that when they meet their victim, they whisper a fate - that they know not just what might be, but what should be, and use their powers to bend the future accordingly.
EDDIC_CRONE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The eddic crone licks her lips, and whispers.
MURDER_THOUSAND_CROWS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=murder of a thousand crows
MURDER_THOUSAND_CROWS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a murder of a thousand crows
MURDER_THOUSAND_CROWS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Trickster is known by many names, but his presence is always announced the same way: by a massive murder of crows, gleeful and cackling.  They settle up in nearby trees, painting the leaves black, and when those trees are completely filled, the remaining birds make roost upon the ground, their bodies a shifting, shimmering effect.  Then, in the space of a moment, they stop.  Their nattering ceases, their pecking stops, and they turn as one to stare coldly, a silence that announces the Trickster has come.
MURDER_THOUSAND_CROWS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The murder of a thousand crows stops cackling, each one of them staring.
WRAITH_WAN_DYING_LIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wraith of wan and dying light
WRAITH_WAN_DYING_LIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wraith of wan and dying light
WRAITH_WAN_DYING_LIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the long years between the decline of the faerie people and the rise of elvenkind, there was another race that walked the earth.  This race was smaller, more delicate, at full height barely larger than a child.  Not the unlings, who some say became the race of man, but something different - chaotic, outside the modes of good and evil.  An after-echo of the fair folk?  Perhaps.  These people bridged the ages, and deep within the old woods, they worshipped the Trickster.  He in turn found them fascinating, embodying some aspect of himself, and so when they passed from memory, he raised their spirits to the heavens: souls trapped out of time, a people never to come again.
WRAITH_WAN_DYING_LIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wraith of wan and dying light says something in a language long since gone.
BLOOD_ANGEL_WHITE_QUEEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blood angel of the white queen
BLOOD_ANGEL_WHITE_QUEEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blood angel of the white queen
BLOOD_ANGEL_WHITE_QUEEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Unlike Urgoth, who delights in killing for its own sake, Shiver's reasons for blood and sacrifice are intensely practical: they unlock different magics beyond what can be learned and transcribed in a book.  When her devotees practice blood sacrifice, it is said that there is sometimes a divine presence, that watching from above, shimmering, is a kind of terrible angel.  Winged, hovering in place, these beings look like flayed men and women.  Their eyes are a mass of maggots and worms, and blood seeps from their mouths, noses, and ears.  When the sacrifice is complete, these seraphim tear the body in two with their enormous strength, gorging on the blood feast before carrying the carcass to their white queen.
BLOOD_ANGEL_WHITE_QUEEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blood angel's face twists into a teeming, dripping smile.
BLOOD_HAWK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blood hawk
NETHER_HOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nether hound
NETHER_HOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nether hound
NETHER_HOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A huge hound, sized somewhere between a mastiff and a small pony, the nether hound is a servant of Shiver chosen for its extreme faithfulness.  It is unknown whether she created them herself, or whether they were some previous monster out of history.  However, scholars have noted that unlike so many heavenly creatures, nether hound really do appear to be animals - they seem to require actual food, and have been seen being fed and petted by the white queen's clergy.  But like animals, they can be quite ill-tempered, and are faithful to a fault: they wordlessly obey Shiver's every command, attacking with their powerful jaws and their ability to breathe frost and cold.
NETHER_HOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nether hound snorts, frost forming in its breath.
ANCIENT_SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient shade
ANCIENT_SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ancient shade
ANCIENT_SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=After death, once the body has broken down and returned to the earth, the soul passes to the underworld, to live in eternity in the quiet world.  It is thought that the entrance is one-way and irreversible - that if the dead can be called, it can be but briefly.  But even laws of life and death must bow before the will of the divine.  In Shiver's quest to understand the universe's wealth of secrets, she calls up spirits for questioning.  But even for her, this is not straightforward.  The spirits are never quite truthful, nor can they be compelled to be so, and as the ancient dead, they rarely want to help.  But a few are grateful for their release, and those that provide her with particularly useful information are often given a choice: return to their rest, or serve her from her seat in the cosmos.
ANCIENT_SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient shade raises a wispy, claw-like hand, and shows you a scene from the distant past.
BLACK_OGRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black ogre
BLACK_OGRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black ogre
BLACK_OGRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The ur-beast from which goblins and ogres are descended, black ogres are created in the image of Urgoth himself.  Standing forty feet tall, they dwarf the ogre of the modern age.  Black-skinned, with mops of silver-white hair, they are as savage as they are primitive.  Their weapons are not so much clubs as instruments of wanton destruction: a tree-trunk lashed with thick rope to a shaped boulder, these mauls can rip through stone walls, shattering blocks several feet thick.  But for black ogres, their strength is in their strength.  They are deeply stupid, largely reactive, terrible at any kind of planning.  But their base stupidity serves them well, for they remain excellent at obeying orders, and love to hear cries of pain and helplessness.  For these reasons, they remain the Black Ogre's favourite, and the speartip of his fearsome assaults.
BLACK_OGRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black ogre spits something at you in a deep, guttural language.
CYCLONIC_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cyclonic beast
CYCLONIC_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cyclonic beast
CYCLONIC_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=On faraway worlds, fantastic storms rage, sometimes for millennia.  Some of these are natural phenomena, caused by atmospheres and weather systems not fully understood.  But others are the work of Urgoth, who delights in destruction, whatever its form.  At the heart of his storms are a strange, nimble creature.  Massive and muscled, they lope like a wolf or lion; when they stop, they rise to stand on two legs.  Green-skinned, bestial, they are covered with a coarse, orange-red hair.  Their snarls can summon storms, and the cut of their attacks is pure electricity.
CYCLONIC_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A cyclonic beast crackles and howls!
DARK_RIDER_COMING_HORDE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dark rider of the coming horde
DARK_RIDER_COMING_HORDE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dark rider of the coming horde
DARK_RIDER_COMING_HORDE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Unlike his fellow divine, who relish in their role of gods and goddesses, Urgoth seems somewhat uncomfortable with this.  Instead, he focuses on his task as an agent of pure destruction.  So lacking the angels of the others, their clarions and holy holy holys, he summons instead something more sinister: black riders on putrescent horses, a kind of coterie, a storm-cloud, a blessed few given strength and speed beyond reckoning.  Members of some ancient order, these riders seem summoned from a deep-set tomb: their thin, almost skeletal bodies rattle in their armour, their skin like paper, their breath beset with rot.  But they are tall, a full ten feet, and carry broadswords sheathed in holy flame.  And they are no undead being; instead, a reflection of the divine, raised by Urgoth's black word.
DARK_RIDER_COMING_HORDE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dark rider raises its visor with a skeletal hand, and its eyes are night and flame.
TEEMING_MASS_WRITHING_TENTACLES_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=teeming mass of writhing tentacles
TEEMING_MASS_WRITHING_TENTACLES_DESCRIPTION_SID=a teeming mass of writhing tentacles
TEEMING_MASS_WRITHING_TENTACLES_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be the physical manifestation of Sceadugenga, black tentacles have been recorded at a number of points in history, when the magical barriers holding back the black god have grown weaker.  The sightings have ranged from a few dozen, to an uncountable number.  The lore has always described them as incredibly slow, creeping like kudzu across the landscape.  As they enter and envelop, they leave behind crumbling statues, something in their touch causing a quick-acting petrification.  In the stories, often farmers have woken to find rocky pieces of their sheep; but there are other, darker tales, that tell of the fall of an ancient seaside city, set upon by what appeared to be a surging, gurgling wave.
TEEMING_MASS_WRITHING_TENTACLES_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=There appear to be millions of tentacles reaching for you; you feel a clenching.
BEAST_BEYOND_FURTHEST_STAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=beast beyond the furthest star
BEAST_BEYOND_FURTHEST_STAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a beast beyond the furthest star
BEAST_BEYOND_FURTHEST_STAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The universe, its said, was created by Celeste - all the stars and cosmos.  A number of cosmologists, though, have pointed out that if the stars are fixed in place, and if the universe is, as the priesthood says, infinite, then there must be a point at which the stars end.  Past this point, strange creatures lurk: many legged, like spiders crossed with wyrms; or jellyfish that move on unseen winds.  These beings live within the blackness of the far cosmos; held back by Celeste, great masses of them wait beyond the fringes.  This divine intervention keeps the universe safe, for these beasts seek to envelop and consume entire worlds, and were they ever released as one, it would mean a certain, final ending.
BEAST_BEYOND_FURTHEST_STAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The beast releases a shrieking howl.
APOCALYPTIC_HELL_BEARS_NO_NAME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apocalyptic hell that bears no name
APOCALYPTIC_HELL_BEARS_NO_NAME_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apocalyptic hell that bears no name
APOCALYPTIC_HELL_BEARS_NO_NAME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Something with no analogy in the world below, the apocalyptic hell that bears no name is a strange thing: shaped almost like a bird, formed entirely of metal, its body is thick and fixed, its four, wing-like protusions unmoving.  At the tip of each wing are long, cylindrical tubes that fire thin beams of intense energy - these can tear apart an asteroid in just a moment.  Within the structure, behind a massive, transparent panel, is some sort of creature - not human, but some sort of massive cephalopod, immersed in a murky fluid, its tentacles sprawled over a mass of controls.
APOCALYPTIC_HELL_BEARS_NO_NAME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The strange, robotic creature regards you dispassionately.
BLOOD_HAWK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blood hawk
BLOOD_HAWK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, savage bird, the blood hawk is so named for the appearance of its large talons after killing its prey.  While other birds tend to attack with the beak, the blood hawk is notable for its reliance upon its talons.  The blood hawk is also notable for its fearlessness, aggressively asserting itself within its domain, unafraid of any challenger.
BLOOD_HAWK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blood hawk shrieks!
ROC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=roc
ROC_DESCRIPTION_SID=the roc
ROC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A beast of myth and legend, the roc is said to have a wingspan to blot out the sun, with feathers of fire and silver and gold.  The few reported sightings tend to be shipwrecked sailors, who claim the great bird capable of rending a ship like paper, leaving them to their doom.  There have been no sightings among the civilized peoples of the world, and as such, the roc remains a story in the eyes of most.
ROC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The roc emits a deafening shriek!
QUAALIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quaalis
QUAALIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quaalis
QUAALIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of ancient myth, the quaalis are said to dwell on massive mountain peaks.  Covered in a permanent layer of frost and ice, they appear almost as statues, their long feathers giving the appearance of armour.  But once they move, they do so with great speed, swooping down towards their prey to grab them in their talons and dash them against the mountainside.  The quaalis are featured prominently in ancient ruins, their images carved into stone to watch high over the dead.
QUAALIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quaalis shrieks, emitting a gale of ice and snow.
SATYR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=satyr
SATYR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a satyr
SATYR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of legend and myth, satyrs combine the features of goats and men.  They have the upper body of a man, save for a small pair of goat's horns; their legs are those of a goat, and they have short tails as well.  Satyrs are often heard before they are seen.  Musical creatures, they love the sound of their reed flutes and pipes, which they carry with them everywhere. 
SATYR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The satyr grins at you, and plays its pipes.
BLACK_MANTICORE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black manticore
BLACK_MANTICORE_DESCRIPTION_SID=the black manticore
BLACK_MANTICORE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The black manticore is a huge beast that resembles a lion, but has a human head with cold, green eyes.  Its fur is short and hard, shiny, and black as charcoal.  An intelligent creature, the black manticore can speak many tongues, able to switch between elven and dwarven, gnomish and the many languages of man.  Its voice is light and airy.  Survivors have told of its timbre resembling pan pipes whistling in the wind.
BLACK_MANTICORE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black manticore chimes, "You are not welcome here.  Say what prayers you will."
ARMOURED_BEETLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large insect with a hard, almost metallic shell, the armoured beetle takes its name from its carapace.  Feeding on grubs and small vertebrates, the armoured beetle lives deep underground, making its home within the soils and caverns of the world.
ROCK_ADDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rock adder hisses slowly.
ROCK_ADDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rock adder is a venomous snake that lives in crevices and cracks, out of the sunlight.  It feasts on small mammals and large insects, and has a particularly potent bite.  Its name is taken from its dull brown-grey colour, which allows it to remain hidden in the rocks and earth.
ACOLYTE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=acolyte
ACOLYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an acolyte
ACOLYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The acolyte murmurs, "Praise be."
ACOLYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Novices of their faiths, acolytes exist for all of the Nine.  They tend to the worship sites, help priests with their tasks, and spend long hours studying holy books.  They typically leave their homes at a young age.  Some take up residence in towns and villages, while others follow the call to the far ends of the world.  Regardless of the route they take, acolytes spend many years in service before becoming blessed priests.
FOX_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox
FOX_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox
FOX_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small mammal, the common red fox is a carnivore that feeds on rabbits, mice, and other such creatures.  Known for their stealth and cunning, foxes prefer to avoid the company of people, who have been known to hunt and eat the creature when food becomes scarce.
FOX_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox yips.
LARGE_ANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=large ant
LARGE_ANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a large ant
LARGE_ANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The large ant is well known as a particularly large member of the artropod family.  Far dwarfing most other insect species, the large ant grows to the size of a man's fist.  And with the increased size comes an increased confidence: large ants feed on small mammals, such as mice and rabbits, and have been known to attack to work in groups to attack unwary adventurers.
LARGE_ANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The large ant rubs its mandibles in anticipation.
CHRISTOF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, barrel-chested gnome, Christof is the elected leader of the Gnordvar gnomes, bearing the title of "Chancellor".  Beneath his surcoat he wears a shirt of fine, gnomish mail, and a jewelled short sword hangs from his waist.  Many years ago, during a goblin raid, Christof repelled the invaders with a small band of his kinfolk, catching the goblins in a narrow mountain trail.  The gnomes destroyed all but a single goblin, sending it back to spread the tale.  Gnordvar has had little trouble with sea-raiders since.
CHRISTOF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Christof exclaims, "Visitors!  How delightful!"
ELFRIC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small, even for a gnome, and very frail, Elfric looks caught somewhere between middle- and old-age.  His beard is long, and unkempt, streaked with grey as well as leaves and twigs.  He wears a tattered, red robe.  Within it, he keeps all manner of powders, metals, and herbs, the base ingredients of his alchemy.
ELFRIC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Elfric whispers, "I require magnesium ore for my flash-powders, but the mines are so dangerous and full of beasts!"
ALFREDO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tall and slender, an adventurer by trade, Alfredo carries his world on his back.  A large leather backpack has been stuffed with clothes and rations, a sleeping roll, and a small tent.  A small stabbing sword hangs from his belt.  His skin is tanned a deep nut-brown by the sun, and his bright eyes twinkle as he talks, mirroring an unconscious half-smile.
ALFREDO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alfredo grimaces. "The mines have been overrun! Christof sent me to investigate, but what lurks there is too strong for me!"
GNOMISH_SAILOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish sailor
GNOMISH_SAILOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish sailor
GNOMISH_SAILOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=
GNOMISH_SAILOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish sailor says, "Saw a strange sight out by a rocky island far to the east.  Looked like an old man - what's he doing out there?"
BARTENDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bartender
BARTENDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the bartender
BARTENDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Smartly dressed in a leather apron and a crisp, pressed shirt, his hair neatly oiled and parted, the bartender provides some welcome relief after a day's toil.  He serves up ale, stout, and whisky from huge barrels behind the bar, always appreciative when patrons tip a little extra.
BARTENDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bartender asks, "Will you have whisky, or beer?"
GNOME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnome
GNOME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnome
GNOME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.  They are intelligent and quick; gnomes love riddles and puzzles, and have a deep affinity for magic.  In combat, they show skill with knives and other short blades.
GNOME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnome says, "The underground's getting rather dangerous lately.  Wonder what it is?"
GNOMISH_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a foot and a half high, the gnomish child's clothes are torn and stained, its hair a mess of leaves and dirt.  The child has either lost or abandoned its shoes, and its feet are tanned the same deep brown as the rest of it.  Its pockets look to be teeming: with bugs and worms, shiny stones, and anything else that has captured its attention, however briefly.
GNOMISH_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish child stares at you with huge eyes. "Can I have some candy?"
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish adventurer
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish adventurer
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among adventurers, it's acknowledged that there are far more gnomes in their profession than in society as a whole.  Though gnomes often keep to their own towns and villages, a large number of them seem to have a natural curiosity that carries them elsewhere.  Gnomes, like dwarves, love being underground, and many think that the disproportionate number of gnomish adventurers is a combination of natural gnomish curiosity, their love of gems, and the siren call of dungeons and ruins to adventurers everywhere.
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish adventurer doffs his cap.
GNOMISH_MINER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Delving deep beneath the earth, hauling ore and gems to the surface, the gnomish miner lives a life in near darkness.  Caked with coal-dust, sweat, and grime, his skin has taken on a greyish hue.  His eyes narrow, squinting, his vision decimated by a life spent underground.  But despite these maladies, with thick, heavy arms, and a broad chest, the gnome looks more like a dwarf, stocky and powerful.
GNOMISH_MINER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish miner says, "My father was a peat-cutter, and I have no spade to follow him.  But I've got my pick; I'll dig with that."
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall man, towering over the gnomes he serves, Theodoric built and maintains the small stone temple in Gnordvar.  After studying as an acolyte in the inner isles, Theodoric was granted a boat and told to make harbour wherever he was needed.  He sailed east, and arrived in Gnordvar a dozen years ago.  With the blessing of its people, he built a temple for the village, and now leads a simple life of prayer and healing among the smallest people of the world.
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Theodoric smiles. "All of Vedere's creatures are welcome here, in our humble temple."
LIGHTNING_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Large, flying insects that glow brightly, lightning bugs store charges of electricity.  They are typically harmless, but will fight back when provoked, and the strength of their electrical charge is so great that it has been known to cause temporary paralysis.
LIGHTNING_BUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lightning bug buzzes and flickers.
GOBLIN_PELTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin pelter
GOBLIN_PELTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin pelter
GOBLIN_PELTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins as a whole are wretchedly poor.  Their knives are often sharpened sticks, or bits of stone, and lacking the money or expertise to create the great bows and crossbows favoured by the other races, they turn to a simple and effective method: stones.  Whether flung by hand or launched from a sling, goblin pelters turn the ubiquitous projectile into something deadly, capable of stunning, cracking bones, and ushering a quick trip to the grave.
GOBLIN_PELTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin pelter idly tosses and catches a stone.
GOBLIN_ALCHEMIST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin alchemist
GOBLIN_ALCHEMIST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin alchemist
GOBLIN_ALCHEMIST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Rarely known for great sorcery, goblins at best tend towards hedge mages, village witches, and the like.  A crude but practical folk, they have a tradition of mixing raw elements to create strange powders and potions.  These lack in any kind of traditional magic, but react in ways that wizards cannot fully understand.  Goblin alchemists are perhaps best known for their bombs: small, apple-shaped balls filled up with explosive powders, and topped with quick-burning fuses.
GOBLIN_ALCHEMIST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin alchemist growls at you from the depths of its ragged hood.
FROST_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small creatures of cold and ice, frost devils travel on freezing winds, culling the sick and infirm, the very young, the dying.  Barely a foot high, they resemble tiny children.  Their skin has a white-grey hue, and their eyes are a bright, startling blue.  They are ferocious.  Knowing no fear, they attack creatures many times their size, slowing them with a bite of terrible, numbing cold.
FROST_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frost devil screams, and a cold wind surrounds you.
FIRE_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of an older time, fire devils live deep within the earth, far past the homes dug by the dwarves and gnomes, with whom they war constantly.  Beings of intense mischief, fire devils arise from cracks and canyons to wreak havoc on living things, igniting with their touch and leaving little but cinders and char, their high-pitched laughs echoing behind.
FIRE_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire devil cackles, and its flames flicker and dance.
AMAUROSIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient wyrm, the last of his kind, Amaurosis lives deep within the caverns of the barren northwest isle.  His body is impossibly long; his mind is even more cunning.  Born of chaotic magics as the world just began, he ravaged the peoples of the world twice in recorded history, finally sealed back by the great warlocks of old.  But as their numbers dwindled, so too did his seal, and it is said that thunder and smoke fill the air once more.
AMAUROSIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient wyrm emits a piercing shriek, causing the caverns to rumble.
EAKAURI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Eakauri
EAKAURI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Eakauri
EAKAURI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Legend has it that the faerie people were all but annihilated when they fought the giants, the remaining few fae fading into the woods and wild.  The truth is that before recorded time, a fiery star crashed into the earth, and contained within this star was a fearsome creature: Eakauri, the undying.  Standing fifty feet tall, it moves with the lithe grace of a housecat, while having the strength of twenty titans.  Its skin is thick and rocky, its eyes glowing like coals.  It has no mouth, but instead speaks telepathically in the language of the subject.  The faerie people rallied for survival, raising powerful armies of sorcerors, bowmen, and swordsmen.  Eventually, Eakauri was defeated, and as punishment imprisoned for eternity in the undersea prison Eka.
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=-So, there was a key after all.  Do you know how long I have lived beneath the sea?  It is but a moment for me, and immeasurable for you.-
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=-The fair folk bound me here with their fey magics.  Forced to fester, I have spent tens of thousands of years here in this room.-
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=-I am Eakauri the undying.  I will have my revenge, and I will start with you!-
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_START_SID=Bagra turns towards you.  Her ancient face is dry and wrinkled, her mouth twisted into a sneer.  She takes a long look to take your measure.
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_START2_SID="You, young adventurer!  You will help me.  Visit the shrines my people watched and never went!  Bring me the relics, all of them!"
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_START3_SID="There are three gems!  Beautiful!  Ancient!  Older then the world itself!  They are life and death and heaven and earth.  I must have them!"
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_START4_SID="I will fuse them together to make a knife that cuts the world!"
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Burn and Sunder
BAGRA_SHRINE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring the three shrine relics to Bagra.
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="The gems!" hisses Bagra.  "Bring them to me!"
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Bagra grabs the gems quickly, and begins a chant.  The gems begin to fuse together, and the black mark on her forehead throbs and bleeds.
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=There is a flash of light, and you suddenly see a thin, black dagger.  Bagra begins to cackle, her laugh like ripping paper.
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="Heart's Needle!  Sweet shadow, I will not disappoint you.  I will bring this to him, and watch it all burn!"
BAGRA_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID=She looks toward you suddenly.  "It is mine!  You cannot have it!  I will bring it to the great wyrm myself!  Die, fool, die!"
FISHERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fisherman
FISHERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fisherman
FISHERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Where there are lakes, rivers, and oceans, there are fisherman: simple, honest folk who feed their families and peoples through the bounty of the waters.  They travel in coracles and skiffs, dromonds and longboats, alone or in teams, fishing with line, nets, and spears.  Salt fish is a common winter staple among many people, who rely on stores of it to see them through to spring.
FISHERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fisherman says, "Good weather, fair winds.  I'll be setting sail soon."
SEAWIFE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seawife
SEAWIFE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seawife
SEAWIFE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Fishermen are married to the open water, but those that take wives must leave them regularly in search of their catch. The seawives tend to the home in the absence of their husbands; they mend clothes and nets, raise the children, and salt the last trip's fish.
SEAWIFE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seawife says, "Each season's the same: catch and salt, and trade at Whaling's End."
WORRIED_MOTHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=worried mother
WORRIED_MOTHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a worried mother
WORRIED_MOTHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Although only in her mid-twenties, the worried mother looks older - her face weather-worn, and creased with concern for her son.  She wears simple linen clothing that has been better days: a belted tunic, leggings, and a worn pair of shoes.  Her eyes look haggard from lack of sleep, and her hair is tangled and unkempt.
WORRIED_MOTHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The worried mother asks, "Have you seen my son, Ead?  He always wanders off, but this time he's at the Barrows..."
EAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ead
EAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ead
EAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young boy, perhaps seven or eight years old, Ead comes from the village of the Isenlings, a gruff, tribal folk at the south-eastern fringes of the world.  He has a child's intense curiosity, one which has not yet been scolded out of him.  His skin has tanned a deep brown, a testament to his time spent outdoors.  His skin looks nicked and scratched, the sort of petty scars left by branches and thorns.  But most curious are his eyes: glittering, a little dark, and strangely intense.
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ead smiles.
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT1_SID="My name is Ead," the boy says.  "I'm from Isen Dun, originally.  I go back to visit my mother, but I'm not welcome there, not anymore."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="I don't fit in.  I don't understand others.  They want simple things, they're never happy, and they don't see things, not really."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="Cynwise told me stories about when the world was young.  How magic was everywhere, in creatures and people, and how it cooled and faded."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID="The wizards write down their secrets to preserve them.  Mystics get whispers.  Witchlings tap into something.  Priests pray."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID="But what if what was never actually faded?  What if it was just forgotten?  The builders, the unlings, the fair folk - all of them."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID="Here, look at this."  Ead closes his eyes and gestures, and a spectacular burst of energy erupts in front of you.
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID=In it, you can see the history of the world, playing out at a dizzying pace - tens of thousands of years in a handful of seconds.
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID="I can't read," he says gravely.  "I'm not religious.  I just put my ear to the earth, and listen."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID="I see things in the night.  Fragments of people and places.  The lovely fair folk.  The race of builders."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID="Some of them are gone, but speaking to me still.  Others are still here.  It's strange and beautiful."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT11_SID=Ead smiles at you.  "Just remember - the things you can see are only a fraction of what actually is."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT12_SID="My mother worries" says Ead, "but the bandits don't bother me - not since they found out what I can do."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT13_SID="As for food, I never go hungry.  Silverweed grows wild around here.  It's bitter, but filling."
EAD_SPEECH_TEXT14_SID="I've got lots of extra plants.  Go on, take some!"
EAD_TELARI_TEXT1_SID=Ead looks at you.  "Some of those who speak to me are the builders.  Their voices are the weakest - they left so very long ago."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT2_SID="They built the shrines, they tell me.  One in each corner of the earth."  Ead looks at you meaningfully, his eyes twinkling.
EAD_TELARI_TEXT3_SID="But there are only three shrines?  Yes - the last was built out of hubris, a tower to span to the heavens themselves."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT4_SID="They gave this tower a name: Telari, the Cloudspire."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT5_SID="The Nine were displeased.  Aurelion was dispatched to deal with this heresy.  He brought his hammer down and tore the land apart."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT6_SID="After the world was shattered, after the tsunami, the tower was gone.  Not a trace.  But the builders were not defeated."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT7_SID="Having harnessed the same ancient magics from which the Nine came, the builders escaped to - well, somewhere else."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT8_SID="They tell me very little, and their secrets are very strange.  But their world, it is an ocean, deep and dark."
EAD_TELARI_TEXT9_SID="Breathing should pose no problem for you.  Shall I send you?  Be warned: you may not be able to return."
EAD_TELARI_CONFIRM_SID=Ead looks at you gravely, then nods.  He utters a single, strange word, and everything goes black.
EAD_TELARI_DENY_SID=Ead nods.
EAD_TELARI_GODSLAYER_TEXT_SID=Ead strains as if to listen.  "Nothing.  The builders are finally gone."
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A smug, simpering creature, the ploughman brags and boasts of his importance within society.  Immortalized by the colloquy of a certain monk, he is less appreciated by his fellow villagers, who see the man as useful, but still an insufferable git.
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ploughman gloats, "Whose grain makes the loaf? Whose turnips make the mash? The ploughman's!"
THE_BLACKSMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=the blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Due to the recent publication of a colloquy on the occupations, the blacksmith's prominent place in society is suddenly under attack.  Formerly lionized for his skills, for crafting weapons of war and implements of peace alike, for smithing spears and shoeing horses, the blacksmith now must fight for respect after a particular monk declared that "the ploughman feeds us all."
THE_BLACKSMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blacksmith scoffs, "That miserable, braggart ploughman!  Who hews his hoe?  Who smelts his steel?"
SMALL_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=small child
SMALL_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a small child
SMALL_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Covered in dirt and filthy rags, the child runs about screaming, ever underfoot.
SMALL_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The small child says, "One, two, slime on my shoe.  Three, four, a wyrm's big roar!"
VILLAGE_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste, maintains a small church within the village of Isen Dun, leading nightly prayers and tending to the sick and wounded.  Called to the service of Celeste at a young age, he studied with the great high priests of the central lands before returning home to his flock.
VILLAGE_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Oswyn intones, "Hail Celeste, empress of heaven, by whose will all things are made."
CYNWISE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An older, childless woman, Cynwise lives at the fringes of Isen Dun.  One of the few villagers with any magical training, Cynwise provides protection for the villagers from the seabound raiders, able to call upon the elements and harness deeper energies.  Still, these powers have made her frightening among her own people, who both respect and fear her.  Not quite an outsider, but not accepted either, Cynwise spends most of her days tending to her books and studies.
CYNWISE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cynwise murmurs, "A poor omen, this cold wind. Do you feel it, %s? Bitter as dragon's breath..."
KEW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A grizzled old adventurer, Kew's glory days are years behind him.  A tall, well-built man with snow-white hair, Kew wears an ornate dagger at his waist as the only indication of his life that was.
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kew says, "The dead are sometimes buried with their favourite possessions."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=Kew muses, "I have heard the Nine like sacrifices, and reward their champions with immeasurable power."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=Kew grins.  "If you want to make your name, you'll want to get off this island.  Hrothgar might give you a key, if you help him."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID=Kew says, "I'm old, but that just means I'm alive.  Remember, you don't have to fight everything you see!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID=Kew says, "It's important to always have ways to escape bad situations."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID=Kew reminds you, "Don't panic, and always consider your options."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID=Kew laughs, "Swords and spears are wonderful, but you're letting people awfully close.  It never hurts to carry a bow, as well!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID=Kew says, "Some armour may provide you with resistances.  Don't ignore these - they will keep you alive when the heaviest plate fails."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID=Kew says, "Tanneries, forges, looms - if you aren't happy with your own equipment, perhaps you could craft something new."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID=Kew says, "The Nine all have their individual likes and dislikes.  Hope you've been paying attention at your services!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT11_SID=Kew says, "When I was a whelp, I was trained by Melura, the dragon-slayer.  Last I heard she was retired, living in the Forest of Yew."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT12_SID=Kew says, "At my best, I once slayed a drakeling.  In its claws was a piece of magici - I've heard dragons covet that more than gold."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT13_SID=Kew muses, "I was once surrounded by fork bugs, and desperately prayed to Celeste.  To my amazement, the breeding stopped, and I escaped!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT14_SID=Kew exclaims, "I once found a mad elf sitting on the bottom of an underground lake, breathing water as if it were air!"
KEW_SUPPLIES_SPEECH_SID=Kew laughs, "Traveller, you will need more than that to stay alive! Take this key, and help yourself to my old equipment."
CADLIND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cadlind
CADLIND_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cadlind
CADLIND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Moon-faced and slender, Cadlind is somewhere at the balance between adulthood and middle age.  A lifetime outdoors has left her skin tanned nut-brown, and her long, flaxen hair is streaked with salt and silver.  She pins it back with a scrimshaw brooch, the ivory engraved with crashing waves and a great, white whale.  Her clothes are shabby.  Her boots show a number of toes, the leather bleached and faded, the stitching badly in need of repair.  Around her shoulders she wears a bear skin shawl, and her right hand idly grips a briar axe.
CADLIND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cadlind says, "I'm just stopping here briefly, and then I'm off again.  I found some old sewers to the north-west.  They seem to go on forever!"
CADLIND_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=Cadlind muses, "I once fought off an animated broom, and it disintegrated into a magici shard.  I guess the stories about constructs are true."
CADLIND_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=Cadlind says, "That boy in the Barrows said he could send me to a fantastic place, if I could breathe water like air..."
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Love in Vain
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Return the wave locket to the girl with the flaxen hair.
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Cadlind starts to say something, but stops when she sees the locket.  "My locket!  It was a gift to a travelling companion, a long time ago now."
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="I loved him so much.  And I think he loved me, but he'd never say the words.  In despair, I left him one day, and spent the rest of my life alone."
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID=She looks stricken.  "I hope the world hereafter is sweeter than this one.  He was a good man.   May our shades meet someday, beneath the Caldera."
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID=Cadlind pulls out her hairpin, and hands it to you.  "Here.  Take this as a token of my gratitude - it will keep you from the fiercest colds."
CADLIND_LOCKET_QUEST_COMPLETE5_SID=She fastens the locket around her neck, and bows.  "Thank you again.  Safe travels.  I think I'll take my leave."
NAMA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Nama
NAMA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Nama
NAMA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A very elderly man, rough-robed and disshevelled, Nama lives in exile from his former land.  Having taken up residence in the fields and cliffs of the little island, he devotes himself to the naming of things: what they are called, and what they call themselves.  He carries a massive, leatherbound text, and deep within the folds of his cloak, he carries an ink pot and a multitude of quill pens.  These he fashions from many birds: pelicans, geese, terns, and for his smallest pens, songbirds such as sparrows and starlings.
NAMA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Nama looks up from his book, a massive, illuminated tome.
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Nama looks up from his tome.  "Look, over there - that sparrow.  You and I, we call it a sparrow, but is that any name for such a lovely thing?"
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="I record the true names of things.  There used to be many people like me, in the older world.  This tome is where the record of all things is kept."
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH3_TEXT_SID=Nama pauses.  "Names are such fluid things.  If you are unhappy with yours, I would be happy to record your new name."
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_SID=Rename?
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_NEW_NAME_SID=Enter your new name: 
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_AFFIRM_SID="Splendid!" exclaims Nama, writing your new name with a flourish of his quill.
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_DENY_SID="Farewell, then!" says Nama, turning his attention back to his book.
IDEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Idem
IDEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Idem
IDEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dressed in hard leather armour, wrapped in a cloak of many-furs, Idem has the appearance of a true adventurer.  While obviously elven, he is quite large and stocky, looking almost closer to human.  His age is betrayed by the short brown hair that has started to grey, and the pronounced crow's feet around his eyes.  Underneath the cloak of furs, his armour shows signs of etchings: ravens, and boars' heads, and other ancient things.  An iron hammer hangs from his waist.  He wears a small backpack that appears ready to burst, crammed with all manner of wands, scrolls, and other rediscovered things.
IDEM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem says, "I'm a bit short on ivory for my trip home.  If you have anything you need identified, perhaps we could work something out."
IDEM_NOT_ENOUGH_IVORY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="I'd need more ivory than you're carrying to tell you about that!"
IDEM_NO_UNID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem nods at you in greeting.  "Come see me if you ever find something you're unsure of."
IDEM_ALREADY_IDENTIFIED_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem says, "I'm afraid I can't tell you anything more about that!"
IDEM_IDENTIFY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem leans in close, and whispers, "Here, let me tell you a little more about that..."
IDEM_IDENTIFY_QUERY_TEXT_SID=He strokes his chin.  "I'd be willing to identify that for %s ivory."
IDEM_ANOTHER_DAY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem shrugs.  "Another day, then!"
WHALER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=whaler
WHALER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a whaler
WHALER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Whaling, with its fraught voyages and isolation, has always attracted a particular type of person.  The long nights and icy winds call the desperate, the loners, and those who love the sea; the journeys to deep and uncharted waters offer a seclusion from the rest of the world, long periods of routine and tedium punctuated by the thrill of sighting a whale.  From there, it's a desperate chase to wound and kill the beast, chasing it until it dies of exhaustion.  Each whale is worth something of a fortune on its own: once cleaned, the blubber can be used for heating oil or tallow, their teeth for ivory, and their meat is rich in nutrients.  But despite this, whalers themselves are never rich.  Most spend a hard life on the sea, staring out towards the horizon, waiting, hoping for a glimpse of black.
WHALER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The whaler murmurs, "Call me Ishmael."
SHOPKEEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shopkeeper
SHOPKEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shopkeeper
SHOPKEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mustachioed, barrel-chested, most shopkeepers of the ancient world were large out of necessity.  Raiders, goblins, and monsters prey on the weak, and in many areas, force is the de facto law.  A scrawny merchant carrying a load of useful items does not last long.  And so each day shopkeepers get up, eat a full dwarven breakfast, and head out to their shop.  They bring with them a lunch packed lovingly by their wives, and wear their finest sword as a deterrent, hoping to make enough ivory to repeat the process tomorrow.
SHOPKEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="Have yourself a look!"
SHOPKEEPER_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_SID=The shopkeeper eyes you critically.  "I'm afraid you're a little short of funds."
SHOPKEEPER_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_DROP_SID="I'm afraid I can't quite afford that, %s!"
SHOPKEEPER_DROP_BUY_OFFER_SID=The shopkeeper offers you %s ivory.
SHOPKEEPER_DROP_BUY_DECLINE_SID="That's a shame," says the shopkeeper.  "Let me know if you change your mind."
SHOPKEEPER_CONFIRM_PURCHASE_SID="Excellent, excellent.  That'll be %s ivory."
SHOPKEEPER_PAY_SID=You hand over the funds.
SHOPKEEPER_SAVINGS_AMOUNT_SID=You haggle the price down to %s ivory.
SHOPKEEPER_PREMIUM_AMOUNT_SID=You haggle the price up to %s ivory.
SHOPKEEPER_THANKS_SID="Thank you for your business!"
SHOPKEEPER_WARNING_SID="Remember to pay before you leave!  I don't take kindly to shoplifters."
SHOPKEEPER_UNINTERESTED_SID=The shopkeeper appears uninterested.
SCRIMSHANDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=scrimshander
SCRIMSHANDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a scrimshander
SCRIMSHANDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Scrimshanders are those who make scrimshaw, ivory carvings or engravings made from whale teeth, walrus tusks, and other sources.  Scrimshanders are often sailors, taking from catches the low-grade ivory that can't be used to make currency.  Others are simply inhabitants of outlying communities who take their material from the washed-up carcasses of giant whales.  Scrimshaw is seen as something of a folk art by those in the central lands, and those that practice it tend to make very personal pieces, engraving scenes that they've witnessed, places they've been, and in the case of many sailors, women they've known.
SCRIMSHANDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The scrimshander says, "I was born here - my parents rafters blown too far south.  Now I just carve, and watch the distant gulls."
SWABBIE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=swabbie
SWABBIE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a swabbie
SWABBIE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among sailors, there is a strict hierarchy that combines both experience and competence.  The newest sailors are swabbies, men and women who have just enlisted aboard a ship's crew and are sailing their first few trips.  Swabbies come from many walks of life, either drawn naturally to the sea, or seeing it as a means of escape.  They are betrayed by their easy gait, free from aches and injury.  Over time, they will weather and hunch and stoop - but not yet.
SWABBIE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The swabbie says, "Captain Bikke is harsh, but fair."
SEADOG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seadog
SEADOG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seadog
SEADOG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Old salts who have served many years for many crews, seadogs have weathered and survived a life on the open sea.  The harsh and physically demanding work has taken its toll - many walk lame, complain of stiffness, or have fingers mangled beyond recognition.  They have the respect of the rest of the crew, and their advice is taken seriously, because of one simple fact: they are still alive.  Whether it's the identification of storm patterns, the knowledge of sea-lanes or sea-monsters, their experience means that they are always a trusted companion to a ship's captain.
SEADOG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seadog barks an order at you.
HARLOT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=harlot
HARLOT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a harlot
HARLOT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Women who sell sex are known by many names, most of derogatory.  Despite the scorn, business is always good.  Whether in small villages or large cities, nomad camps or port towns, harlots are always able to carve out some sort of a living, however meagre or dangerous.  And it is dangerous: most of these women know friends who were murdered or just disappeared, and every one of them carries a well-hidden knife buried somewhere in her clothes.
HARLOT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The harlot winks.  "Hello, sailor!"
HRETHEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrethel
HRETHEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrethel
HRETHEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Hrethel the Isenling came to Whaling's End in his late teens.  Having spent years studying the few books of his aunt, Cynwise, he was struck by wanderlust and took a whaling ship to the remote outpost.  Here, he earns a subsistence living: in exchange for his quarters, a small cabin on an outlying islet, he works weather cantrips, bringing favourable winds and calm seas around the island fortress.  As ships dock in the rocky, deepwater port, and their crews look to trade their goods, Hrethel barters for books and scrolls with carvings made from ivory and soapstone.  For he has become quite good at this: at this southern extreme, the winter nights are endless, and in the flicker of candlelight, he carves, and carves, and reads.
HRETHEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hrethel says, "I've plenty of books, but no magici to speak of.  It seems harder to come by, now.  Bring me a score and I'll give you a book."
HRETHEL_TRADE_SID="Looks like you've got plenty of magici!" says Hrethel.  "Any chance you'd trade a score of it for one of my spellbooks?"
HRETHEL_TRADE_DEAL_SID="Wonderful!" says Hrethel.  He hands you a worn, leatherbound book.
HRETHEL_TRADE_NO_DEAL_SID=Hrethel grimaces.  "Sad.  I could've really used it!  Let me know if you change your mind."
MAISY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Maisy
MAISY_DESCRIPTION_SID=Maisy
MAISY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Seemingly dim, slow-speaking, Maisy is one of the Roani who remain on the high, rocky island known as Rowan Head.  Clearly a young woman, she nevertheless looks aged - her face is creased, her hair bleached by the sun and sea-salt.  There is a deep sadness about her, a sense that a part of her is gone, evident in her unwashed clothes, the clenching of her fingers, her long-look stare.
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Maisy smiles at you sweetly.  "They say I'm dim, but I'm not.  Just slow to speak.  Slow to consider things.  Slow to anger, slow to wake."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="There were seven of us after the ships left: Franck the Fisher, Old Toller, my husband Halde and I.  And my girls.  My three sweet girls."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="They were born broken.  Dim, crook-legged, they clung to me like bandy birds.  Such tiny arms they had, tiny bodies, and tiny little brains."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID="Esha, Yarrow, Jayne - they never learned their names, just babbled queerly in a strange, clicking tongue.  They ran so strangely -"
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID="But oh, how they swam!  Three little seals that hunched and clucked down to the water, where they caught the waves from the quick, crashing sea."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID="My husband Halde claimed they weren't right: more seal than girl, as if they were selkies themselves, black-eyed, sea-seeking."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID="One day, I came home and found the girls were gone.  I called their names desperately, but I heard nothing but the hard evening air."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID="Then I looked out the window, and saw something on the rocks.  Three bodies, red and wet, staining the sea-form with their gore."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID="In the distance, at Rowan Point, their skins were hanging from the tree."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID="My husband did it.  Said he took the magic out of them.  Led them to the cliffs, cut their throats, and slowly peeled their skins."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT11_SID="I cried and cried.  Dug them barrows, planted flowers over top.  And then I waited, until the last ship sailed for the central lands."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT12_SID="That night, when Halde would have had me, I tied him to my bed, then skinned him from throat to foot.  Toller never came, nor Frank.  They knew."
MAISY_SPEECH_TEXT13_SID="Each day I visit their flowery graves.  And when the harbour seals watch me from the point, I can feel them - Yarrow, Esha, Jayne."
OLD_TOLLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Old Toller
OLD_TOLLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Old Toller
OLD_TOLLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient man, perhaps ninety years old, Old Toller is one of the last inhabitants of Rowan Head, and one of the few that did not leave with the ships.  His hair is stark white, and cut close.  He wears simple wool clothing, woven from the wool sheared from sheep that used to walk the high peaks.  Tucked into his belt is a fish knife, along with a number of hooks and lures.  The sheep are long gone, the young folk too.  All that remains of Rowan Head are a few folk that refused to give up their home; and around them, the endless sea.
OLD_TOLLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Old Toller shakes his head.  "Poor Maisy," he says sadly, "to lose not one girl, but three.  And in such an awful way..."
FRANCK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Franck
FRANCK_DESCRIPTION_SID=Franck
FRANCK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A man in early middle age, Franck's long, brown hair falls to his shoulders, softening somewhat his sombre scowl.  His face is ugly and scarred - a broken nose, probably broken often, a scraggly beard, and a small, circular scar in his left cheek, which looks as if it may have been given by a fish hook.  A number of fish knives line his belt, and he wears a dirty, rough wool sweater that stinks of lanolin.  He lives with his father, Old Toller, and does most of the fishing for the teetering community, catching cod and killing the odd seal for its meat, blubber, and pelt.
FRANCK_TEACH_FISHING_PREREQ_SID=Franck growls, "I'll teach you to fish for a hundred ivory.  Come back when you've got it!"
FRANCK_TEACH_FISHING_SID=Franck speaks gruffly.  "We need ivory to trade with passing ships.  I'll teach you to fish for a hundred pieces of ivory."
FRANCK_TEACH_FISHING_DECLINE_SID=Franck shrugs.  "Don't starve."
FRANCK_TEACH_FISHING_COMPLETE_SID="See?" he says.  "Nothing to it!  The ocean is teeming with fish.  Salmon, cod, snapper..."
FRANCK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Franck frowns.  "Help yourself to our stores.  The sea about here is full of cod.  We'll never go hungry."
EXILE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=exile
EXILE_DESCRIPTION_SID=The exile
EXILE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The exile looks at you sadly.  "I am an exile, the last of my kin.  This is my home til the salt eats my bones."
EXILE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient man, dressed in little more than rags, the exile is hobbled and bent.  Cast away to the edge of the world, he lives his life far from the forces that sent him here.  His only colour comes from his deep green eyes, and a number of gold rings that adorn his right hand.
FARMER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=farmer
FARMER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a farmer
FARMER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A vital part of any settlement, the farmer provides food from the earth to feed his people.  Knowledgable about agriculture, herbalism, and other matters, the farmer provides vital sustenance when stocks of meat and fish wane.
FARMER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The farmer says, "A good crop, last year.  And we owe it to one man - the ploughman."
LAYPERSON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=layperson
LAYPERSON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a layperson
LAYPERSON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the nine, those who are members of a church or temple, but not formal members of the religious organization, are termed the laity.  These people are responsible for day-to-day operations of the churches and temples and their services.  This can include sweeping the floors, acting as an usher or acolyte during a service, or any number of other tasks.  Laypeople outnumber the clergy by a large number, and fill an important role in the religious community.  It has often been noted that without the clergy, there would be no church, but without the laity, the church could not function.
LAYPERSON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The layperson says, "Mind the braziers."
DEVOTEE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=devotee
DEVOTEE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a devotee
DEVOTEE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Part of the everyday throng of parishioners and temple-goers, devotees are particularly strong in their faith.  They attend services regularly, tithe a portion of their income, and attempt to live out the tenets of their deity in their everyday life.  Their faith gives them a staff to lean on in tough times, and an escutcheon against the whispers of monsters and demons.
DEVOTEE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The devotee says, "Praise be!"
FOLLOWER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=follower
FOLLOWER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a follower
FOLLOWER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers attend services largely because it is expected, because in every community there exist certain expectations with regards to religion.  They go because their neighbours go, and because if they do not, their neighbours will talk.  So once or twice a week, followers put on slightly nicer clothes, and spend an hour or two listening to the clerics preach their teachings.  And after, they go home, change, and get on with the rest of their lives.
FOLLOWER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The follower nods hello.
APOSTLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apostle
APOSTLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apostle
APOSTLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The power of the Nine's religious followings is focused in the central lands.  To spread the word out to the far reaches, the churches and temples use apostles.  These men and women are deeply devoted, and travel sometimes for years to reach remote villages and camps.  They set up small worship sites out of whatever is at hand: logs, sod, rough stone.  And once this is done, they preach their religious teachings, and send regular missives back home.  
APOSTLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apostle regards you warmly.
PILGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pilgrim
PILGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There are many important religious sites throughout the world, and pilgrims travel to these out of sense both of devotion and adventure.  How else to describe sailing many thousands of miles to visit the bones of a saint brought down in a hail of arrows, or the first tiny stone church built for the skraelings of the north?  Pilgrims spend a life on the road, travelling from place to place, carried only by their faith and the sense that there is always something new to see, something that will, for a moment, bring them ever closer to the Nine.
PILGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pilgrim
PILGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pilgrim greets you with a weary voice.
YOUNG_WOMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=young woman
YOUNG_WOMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a young woman
YOUNG_WOMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in a bonnet and dress, the young woman has not yet been married off to an appropriate suitor.  For a short time, her life is hers to enjoy, until her family finds her a suitable man.  For once they have children, the rest of her life is essentially set.  Her days will be full of domestic tasks and chores, caring for the children, cleaning their home.  Once the children grow up, if they survive the ravages of disease and chance, then her remaining years are dwindling and few, each glance at the mirror an unspoken question: where has the time gone?  And where have I gone with it?
YOUNG_WOMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The young woman smiles at you sweetly.
TRADESMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tradesman
TRADESMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tradesman
TRADESMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tradesmen include carpenters and joiners, stonemasons, tilelayers, and bakers.  They count among themselves the members of any skilled trade, and tradesmen typically spend their lives mastering a particular craft.  They are an essential part of any village or town, and occupy a place on the social scale above unskilled manual workers, but below the shopkeepers and merchants.
TRADESMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tradesman tips his cap.
MERCHANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=merchant
MERCHANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a merchant
MERCHANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Merchants facilitate the flow of goods to and fro, whether by arranging the shipping of tons of rugs and spices, or simply driving a wagon of small wares down a country road.  By and large, merchants tend to be well off.  By making a small profit on each item sold, merchants are able to afford good housing, plenty of food, and often are able to hire protection for journeys that would otherwise be ill-considered in the face of pirates, bandits, and monsters.
MERCHANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The merchant flashes a gold-toothed smile.
TRAVELLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=traveller
TRAVELLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a traveller
TRAVELLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=For some people, wanderlust is not just a word, but a real, driving feeling.  They feel the distance calling, that somewhere down the road is surely better than here.  Those travellers, wanderers, wayfarers - however they prefer to be called - carry their lives on their back, moving from place to place, never staying long.  Their possessions are typically meagre: a bedroll, some food and a waterskin, a walking stick, a knife.  But they are enough to support them as they wander from town to town, or as they live off the land in spring and summer.
TRAVELLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The traveller nods at you wearily.
GUARDSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=guardsman
GUARDSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a guardsman
GUARDSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Every village has at least a few guardsmen, men and women tasked with tasked with defending the village from the many threats beyond the borders.  And there are many: goblin raiders roam the seas, bandits walk the roadways, and there have been more and more reports of strange, ancient monsters.  Guardsmen tend to be lightly armed and armoured with whatever is at hard.  Scraps of armour, ill-fitting helmets, and rickety spears are all common, as are varying levels of skill and bravery.
GUARDSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The guardsman salutes you with his spear.
WATCH_CAPTAIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=watch captain
WATCH_CAPTAIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a watch captain
WATCH_CAPTAIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In each village, the watch generally consists of peasant farmers, merchants, and others who can barely hold a spear.  But commanding them are hard men: former soldiers and bodyguards, even some mercenaries, who wear real armour and carry keen, well-forged swords.  The watch captains ensure the safety of the village, acting as leaders and commanders.  They organize the archers, spearmen, and guardsmen, and then act as the final layer of defense against the dark things of the world.
WATCH_CAPTAIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The watch captain hails you.
SPEARMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spearman
SPEARMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spearman
SPEARMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lowest member of the infantry, the spearman nonetheless plays an essential role in any watch or military organization.  Spears require little in the way of training, and are remarkably cheap to make, requiring comparatively much fewer resources than a sword or even an axe.  Despite this, spears remain remarkably effective weapons, turning even the simplest peasant into a deadly foe.  For the lowest classes, the spears may be little more than sharpened sticks, while soldiers may have sturdy, well-balanced spears, suitable for throwing or close combat.
SPEARMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spearman twirls his spear at you.
ARCHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=archer
ARCHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an archer
ARCHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skilled at ranged combat, archers can be armed with anything from simple rocks, to slings and spears, or bows and crossbows.  Lightly armoured, they typically wear simple clothing or some sort of uniform and carry only a knife or club for close-quarters combat.  Preferring to fight from a distance, they strike their opponents relentlessly from a distance, weakening or killing them before letting the spearmen or cavalry do their work.  Archers tend to have much more training than simple infantry, as the aim and focus required is something cultivated over a lifetime.
ARCHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The archer cocks an eyebrow.
HILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hild
HILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hild
HILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the ploughman may feed us all, the weaver is just as important, weaving clothes from base fibres, knitting scarves and gloves from sheep's wool, practicing an ancient and largely thankless trade.  In Isen Dun, Hild is that weaver.  A woman of middle age, she wears tidy, well-made clothing, and pins her hair up tightly.  Her wheel and loom are aged, but well-maintained, and candlelight can often be seen from her hut as she works late into the night, weaving cloaks, clothes, and robes.
HILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hild says, "You'll need some practice and a fibre like whiteflower puff if you want to operate the wheel and loom."
TANNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tanner
TANNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tanner
TANNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The treating of hides with tannins is the most basic way to create leather.  The process is dirty, smelly, and generally dangerous, causing wasting diseases later in life due to prolonged exposure to the tannins.  Despite the lower status of the trade, tanners are well-valued by the communities in which they live.  They provide leather for clothing, for tents, for armour - the durability of leather makes it suitable for many things.  Tanners themselves tend to be practical, down-to-earth types.  They toil long hours for little pay, but are aware of their worth: along with the smith, the community's tanner provides the basic equipment a community needs to deal with the ever-present threat of raiders and monsters.
TANNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tanner says, "Skins can become many things: a fine cap, a soldier's cuirass, a sturdy pair of boots, or a cloak to keep out the weather."
HRIMGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of the Isenlings, Hrimgar is a tall, regal man.  Just a shade under forty, his hair and beard have begun to grey; but despite this, he still looks strong and powerful, and is said to still lead the charge of his people into battle.
HRIMGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hrimgar says, "You are welcome in our lands, traveller."
SIRIATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Siriath
SIRIATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Siriath
SIRIATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Taking up residence in the dungeons south-east of Isen Dun, Siriath works by torch-light, delving into black and unspeakable things.  An elderly man, he appears every one of his eighty three years.  His skin is thin and papery, his hair waist-length, unkempt, stringy and full of knots.  His eyes are blue and startling, beautiful, but full of hate.  Walking with aid of his staff, he nonetheless seems to draw his strength from some otherworldly resevoir, working day and night without sleeping, desperately trying to grasp greater truths before his years come to an end.
SIRIATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Siriath screams at you, his voice full of rage and hate.
GARROS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ugly, scarred man, Garros is missing an eye, an ear, and several teeth.  The remnants of a ratty cape hang from his shoulders, closed by a cheap wooden clasp, and his boots look ill-fitting.  But at his waist you can see a large, stone hammer, its curved head filthy and caked with blood.
GARROS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Garros cackles, "How appropriate that you shall perish here!  Your life shall a-mound to nothing!"
SWEET_OLD_DOG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sweet old dog
SWEET_OLD_DOG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sweet old dog
SWEET_OLD_DOG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A sweet old beagle, with enormous paws he never grew into, the many years reveal themselves on him.  His face is now completely white, his ears stiff and wrinkled from a long series of hematomas.  Sometimes when he gets up, his hind legs slip - a bit of arthritis - and he catches himself and grumbles.  His eyes are slowly clouding.  He's been deaf for years.  But he'll still tell you when it's suppertime, still follow you outside every morning, wander through the trees and bushes, fall asleep in the warm grass by your feet.  Every time you look at him, there he is: the puppy who ran wild, chasing things you couldn't see or smell; the dog who barked at squirrels, tracked rabbits and hares, lost his mind at the scent of a nearby deer.  The sweet old hound who'd lie nearby, offering his stomach for a quick rub as you passed, who every evening nestled into a pile of blankets he insisted that you put on him yourself: good boy.
SWEET_OLD_DOG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sweet old dog lies down beside you.
HOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hound
HOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hound
HOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large dog descended at some point from wolves, the hound is easily trained by men for guarding, work, or even just companionship.  Hounds are smaller than their wolven brethren, and less muscular, but they can still be ferocious when provoked.
HOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hound growls.
WHITE_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The white wolf is a larger cousin of the common wolf.  Typically found in colder climates, its silvery-white fur provides natural camouflage in the snow-covered arctic tundras and boreal forests.  Despite the size of the species, the white wolf possesses a high-pitched howl, closer in timbre to a coyote's.  They typically feed on mammals such as deer, foxes, and rabbits, but in times of hunger, they have been known to attack camps and settlements.
WHITE_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The white wolf growls.
CYCLOPS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cyclops
CYCLOPS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cyclops
CYCLOPS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient race of giants, the cyclopes tower over the tallest giants and ogres.  The cyclops is distinguished by a single eye in the middle of its forehead.  Typically at least sixty feet tall, they dress in patchwork skins sewn from elephant and rhino hides.  They are quick to anger.  Cyclopes carry clubs fashioned from the trunks of huge trees, the ends studded with spikes of mammoth tusks.  They live deep in the highest mountain ranges, gathering in small clans to build stone dwellings and live their lives far from the rest of the world.
CYCLOPS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cyclops thunders, "I shall destroy you!"
CHIMERA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chimera
CHIMERA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chimera
CHIMERA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chimeras are the monstrous fusion of a goat's body, a lion's head, and a serpent tail.  Agents of pure chaos and destruction, they breathe fire, attacking anything in their way.  While they were originally thought to be the recent creation of Sceadugenga, a number of bronze statues from long-lost civilizations have been unearthed, suggesting these creatures terrorized the civilized world as far back as recorded time.
CHIMERA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chimera hisses, bleats, and roars.
WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyrm
WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyrm
WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though the modern "worm" derives from the ancient "wyrm", it does its ancestor no justice.  Wyrms are massive, fire-breathing serpents that live deep beneath the earth: in caverns, mines, and any other passage large enough to house their massive forms.  They have a deep love of gold.  Greedy and hungry, they lie coiled on their great hoards, aware of each coin, each goblet and gem.  Their anger is immense, and when they roar, the very earth trembles.
WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyrm opens its great jaws to the sky, and breathes a terrible flame high into the air.
DRUNK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drunk
DRUNK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drunk
DRUNK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Behind the finest wines and whiskies, the most complex beers is a simple truth: all alcohols are just the result of fermentation, the combination of liquefied sugars, yeast, and time.  And while connoisseurs talk of notes and noses, aromas and mouthfeel, some people just want to drink for quantity, pounding drink after drink until they collapse and briefly forget the pain they hold inside.
DRUNK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drunk burps and staggers.
URCHIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=urchin
URCHIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=an urchin
URCHIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=If the true measure of a people is how they treat their weakest and most vulnerable, the Carcassian empire is damned indeed.  Despite the great wealth owned by a small group of ancient families, most struggle to survive, with the death of a parent often being a ticket to poverty.  Many of these children end up on the street, forced to beg, or in the absence of any semblance of charity, more active measures.  The most daring finger the pockets and purses of the unsuspecting before melting away into the alleys and gutters of the poor quarters of town.  It's said that some even act as eyes and ears of the Guild of Thieves, blending unseen through the crowds to listen at doors and windows to things they should not hear.
URCHIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The urchin grins, and you see it sidle closer.
THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thief
THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thief
THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Disliked everywhere and trusted nowhere, the thief lives outside of society, taking what he can, and by force if necessary.  Many work alone, but in the larger central cities, they have been known to form guilds, forging a common bond and language.  They are despised by those who do honest work, who see them as uncouth at best, and murderous at worst.  This is not entirely incorrect.
THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thief scowls, "I'll spill your guts, then take the coins from your eyes!"
APPRENTICE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apprentice
APPRENTICE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apprentice
APPRENTICE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Apprentices study the arcane arts under practicing wizards.  As with acolytes and their holy path, apprentices leave their homes at a young age to work under established wizards, where they learn to read Old Runic, prepare herbs and distillations, and acquiring other prerequisites to the magical arts.  Their days are spent in service, assisting their master, while their nights are spent reading ancient texts, mastering the language and linguistics of the old magics.  After a number of years, once their study is deemed satisfactory, they receive their wizard's staff.  Each will say, though, that the staff is truly only the beginning of their study.
APPRENTICE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apprentice murmurs, "All men pass to dust, but what we study in life defines us."
THAUMATURGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thaumaturge
THAUMATURGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thaumaturge
THAUMATURGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Somewhere between witchlings and priests lies the thaumaturge, possessors of magical powers they consider gifted and controlled by the Nine.  Combining holy devotion with these innate magical skills, thaumaturges are able to fuse the mortal and the divine to create great magical acts.  They are often seen as miracle-workers, but it is this same ability that fuels a distrust among the common folk, and as a result, thaumaturges rarely stay in one place for long.  Forced to wander, thaumaturges exist at the edge of the civilized world, pushed back by fears and superstitions they can never understand.
THAUMATURGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thaumaturge says, "The world is full of wonders we have yet to understand."
SQUIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=squire
SQUIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a squire
SQUIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To become a knight, one must possess the correct personal or family status, but that is not sufficient, itself.  One must undergo a number of years of training, learning under the watchful eye of a knight, before being granted knighthood.  Those that attend to and fight under a knight are squires.  Typically the sons of nobility, squires learn to read and write, to fight with the sword and lance, and the correct way in which to carry themselves.  Only once they have done this, and proven their mettle in battle, are they granted the title of knighthood, with all the privileges it entails.
SQUIRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The squire looks at you boldly.
SHIMMERING_CLOUD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shimmering cloud
SHIMMERING_CLOUD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shimmering cloud
SHIMMERING_CLOUD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Puffs of pure magic, shimmering clouds are said to be the product of magics gone awry, the far-off manifestation of the failure of a student to correctly cast a spell.  Gaseous and unstable, they crackle with magical energy, and are believed to be able to cast the very magics that summoned them into being.
GAS_CLOUD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gas cloud
GAS_CLOUD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gas cloud
GAS_CLOUD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Bright yellow-green clouds that roil and rumble, gas clouds are said to be the hateful spirits of the recently dead.  Those whose circumstances prevent them from passing peacefully into the world beyond often find themselves trapped, their mindless spirits pinned to the physical world.  And for those troubled souls who did not go gently, their discontent coalesces in the air.  It reacts with stray and unstable gases, binding them together - for a time.  For it is said that when the spirit is finally released, the result is an explosive reaction of hate and fire.
GRAVEROBBER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=As the thief is to the honest occupations, so is the graverobber to thieves.  Possessing none of the respect for the dead (and many of their possessions), the graverobber makes his wealth off the death of others, disinterring the dead for their weapons, ivory, and gold.
GRAVEROBBER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The graverobber laughs, "You know what I love best about my job? The dead can't protest!"
BLACKGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackguard
BLACKGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackguard
BLACKGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Blackguards are known by many other names: mercenary, sellsword, brigand, outlaw.  Usually possessing only a simple sword and the clothes on their back, they rely on their wits and skill in combat to make a living, fighting in armies in other peoples' wars, or simply waylaying strangers on back roads.
BLACKGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A blackguard spits, "You worthless cur! I'll cut you down where you stand!"
GIANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant
GIANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant
GIANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Giants are ancient creatures, who warred with the faerie folk in the first age of the world.  But their descendents found themselves feared and shunned by the races that followed, and now live a marginalized existence, gathering in small villages and huddling together for protection.  For though a giant is a formiddable opponent, the other races found that the giants' great strength could be countered by use of a large number of scattered archers.  Consequently, large numbers were hunted or driven away, and the few that remain are wary of the words of outsiders.
GIANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant bellows, "Fee Fi Fo Fum!"
GIANT_STONETOSSER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant stonetosser
GIANT_STONETOSSER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant stonetosser
GIANT_STONETOSSER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though the giants who practice ranged combat by tossing massive boulders are often referred to as stonetossers, it really does them little justice.  The boulders they throw, with a strength that makes it look easy, can be the size of a warhorse or larger, unliftable by ten men.  These giants are deeply feared, and legends are told of a cavalry rush in ages past that met a spectacular end when a giant stonetosser rolled a massive boulder through the charging horsemen.
GIANT_STONETOSSER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant roars.
ROCK_GRINDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock grinder
ROCK_GRINDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock grinder
ROCK_GRINDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange and massive combination of beetle and spider, the rock grinder combines the eight legs quick reflexes of an arachnid with a hard, almost metallic exoskeleton.  Rock grinders grow almost six feet long, and their shells can grow several feet thick, causing problems for all but the heaviest hammer and keenest blade.  Their sharp jaws can easily tear a man in two.  Etchings of the creatures have been found at the mouth of caves and caverns, perhaps as a warning by the early peoples of the dangers lurking below.
ROCK_GRINDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rock grinder rubs its mandibles with glee.
ROCK_GRINDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant earthshaker
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant earthshaker
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=All giants are dangerous foes, but their elite fighters are the earthshakers.  They wear armour made of massive stone plates, strung together with corded steel, and wield two-handed clubs the size of two large men.  Though slowed by their immense armour, they make up for it with a tremendous strength that they can use to destroy stone walls, portcullises, and other elements of fortifications.  Men who find themselves at the receiving end of a blow from a giant earthshaker rarely live, and even then, are rarely recognizable.
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ground thunders as the giant earthshaker approaches.
MAGMOS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=magmos
MAGMOS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a magmos
MAGMOS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to live deep within the earth, magmos are instead magical creatures that are conjured by powerful magi.  They resemble a long, thick snake, with a human head; but where a snake would be made of flesh and scale, a magmos' entire body is made of coals and flames.  Creatures of intense fury, their presence is announced by a terrible burning, as little can withstand their flames.  Their heads seem to gnash and roar with fury, the bodies thrashing wildly, and when the magic binding them comes undone, they vanish as quickly as they came.
MAGMOS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The magmos roars, a blast of flame erupting from its jaws.
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant griffinrider
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant griffinrider
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though horses are the preferred mount for human and elven cavalry, there is no horse alive large enough for a giant.  And so, many thousands of years ago, the first griffin was domesticated by a giant, and taught to allow a rider.  Since then, giants have bred and trained griffins for combat.  There is little more terrifying to an army than looking up to see a griffin descending, talons outstretched, while the armour giant upon it readies its massive club.
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The griffin shrieks and groans under the load.
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant cloudwalker
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant cloudwalker
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The average giant stands three times the height of a man.  But sometimes, an exceptionally tall giant is born.  These giants, known as cloudwalkers by the other races, stand the height of six men.  Their ability in combat is terrifying, as their massive strength allows them to tear through plate armour bare-handed, crush skulls like eggs, and smash through walls single-handedly.  Cloudwalkers often become chiefs, with the other giants deferrential to their mighty strength and terrifying tempers.
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant cloudwalker laughs raucously.
WEEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=weeper
WEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a weeper
WEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Told of in fireside tales, weepers are mentioned in low voices, lest they be summoned by their name.  It is said that they are heard before they are seen, their unearthly presence announced by the soft sound of weeping.  The sobbing is low, piteous, and incessant; it is said that once the sobbing is heard, the one hearing it will hear nothing else for days.  Unable to rest, unable to take any pleasure in food or drink, the victim slowly begins to hallucinate, and finally go mad.  It is at this point that the weeper appears, always a young girl or child, dressed in dirty rags, her empty eyes white and bleeding, her final touch colder than death.
WEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The weeper sobs quietly.
OGRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre
OGRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre
OGRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogres are huge and thickly-built, with the strength of many men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures' fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.  Ogres make up for this with a tremendous strength and fortitude.  They are often seen wearing scraps of armour plundered from their kills, and often carry some sort of club, some even wielding the trunks of small trees.
OGRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre snarls, "I'll grind your bones to make my bread!"
OGRE_HURLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre hurler
OGRE_HURLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre hurler
OGRE_HURLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While elves are known for their accuracy with bow and arrow, and dwarves with crossbow and bolt, ogres prefer to simply toss trees at those they dislike.  Fashioning crude missiles from large sections of tree trunks, they hurl these cabers with ferocious strength and speed.  While these may lack the accuracy of an elven longbow, they make up for this in the sheer destructive power created on impact: breaking bones, crushing spines, the cabers take a terrible toll.
OGRE_HURLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre hurler growls at you, and flexes its enormous arms.
OGRE_SAVAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Evil and cruel, even for ogres, ogre savages wear their fallen foes.  They wear necklaces made from their victims' skulls.  The skins are tanned and made into clothing, and their clubs are spiked with bones.  Ogre savages tend to wear little armour, preferring to fortify themselves with strange potions brewed by their shamans.
OGRE_SAVAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre savage roars, "I'll add your skull to my necklace!"
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre bonegrinder
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre bonegrinder
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=So called for their habit of grinding the bones of their dead opponents to sprinkle into their firewater, ogre bonegrinders are ruthless, efficient warriors.  Unlike most ogres, their skill in combat and social standing means that they have had specially-made armour, typically loose steel plates over leather.  Their bodies are covered in scars - some given by the dead, others self-inflicted, for bonegrinders believe that they must not exit combat without having bled in some capacity.
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre bonegrinder looks at you and licks its lips.
OGRE_MAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre mage
OGRE_MAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre mage
OGRE_MAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogre magi share some similarities with sages, who through careful study are able to cast all kinds of spells.  But though sages acquire their knowledge through decades of work, ogre magi are far more crude, passing their knowledge down from one mage to the other by means of a strange alphabet only they can understand.  The high wizards scorn these learnings, considering them laughably primitive, but it is undeniable that ogre magi can both conjure the elements, and see glimpses of events in the far past and future.
OGRE_MAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre mage's green, cat-like eyes glitter from beneath its cowl.
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre war captain
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre war captain
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When ogres go to war, the bands are led by fearsome war captains, ogres who through years of brutal killing have risen to the top of their hierarchy.  Unlike most other ogres, who prefer heavy, blunt objects, the war captains prefer massive greatswords, which allow them to tear through the things in front of them.
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre war captain draws his sword and aims it towards you.
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre annihilator
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre annihilator
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wearing black-steel armour, armed with greatswords or vicious halberds, ogres annihilators are masters of calculated savagery.  Having studied with the magi and fought as brothers with the war captains, they fight with the combination of this experience.  Their weapons are infused with magical might, their armour protected with ancient wards.  And they fight with a cunning and strength that overmatches all but the mightiest foes.
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre annihilator releases a primal scream.
URGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Armoured in scraps of plate, carrying a huge, spiked club, Urgrim is an imposing presence.  His eyes burn beneath the visor of a plundered helm, beady and small, full of hate.  Leader of his band, he arrived at his authority through ruthlessness, slaughtering the previous chief in full view of his tribe and daring any to try the same with him.
URGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Urgrim spits, "I'll hang your flayed skin on the walls of my camp!"
SKAAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Skaal
SKAAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Skaal
SKAAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of Stoneheim, Skaal Greybeard has ruled the Great Hall of the Mountains since boyhood.  "The boy-chief", as he was known, ascended to the granite throne when his father and grandfather were slain in battle, falling to the goblin hordes.  Skaal grew up quickly, mediating disputes, learning history and politics, and training in the battleaxe.  His sound judgement have made him popular with his people, and he is regarded as proud and fair by those leaders who have dealt with him.
SKAAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Skaal says, "Hail, adventurer, and welcome to Stoneheim."
GILDI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gildi
GILDI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gildi
GILDI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An elderly dwarf, white-beard and hunched by age, Gildi wears a long black robe that flows behind him, bobbing gently as he walks.  He has a soft voice, firm but friendly; his movements are slow but meaningful.  It is said that Gildi is a sage of uncertain age.  Certainly he has lived in Stoneheim his entire life, bartering books and manuscripts from passing sailors, his days and nights spent in constant study.  During the last goblin incursion, the dwarves swear that Gildi rained fire from the heavens on the coming ships, and for his part, Gildi has never denied this.  He is content to live out his days in the mountain halls, acting as healer and wizard, and helping the priest to tend the church.
GILDI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Gildi nods at you.  "I can tell you've come this way for something."
THENGIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thengil
THENGIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thengil
THENGIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The smith of Stoneheim, Thengil cuts an imposing figure.  His hair and beard flow down past his waist, both braided and coal-black.  His skin is dark, too, marking him as a black dwarf, an offshoot of dwarvenkind who came to the surface years ago and adapted physically to a blazing hot climate.  Thengil operates the heavy forges, crafting weapons and armour for the dwarves of the mountain.  Exceptionally skilled at his craft, his weapons are sought far beyond the dwarven kingdom, beloved by adventurers and mercenaries for the perfection of their balance and heft.
THENGIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Thengil nods at you, his face blackened by his forge.
TINDR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tindr
TINDR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tindr
TINDR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A short, lean dwarf, Tindr is one of the few who regularly leaves the comfort and protection of the mountains to venture into the world beyond.  Still a youth by dwarven standards, he keeps his face close-shaved, and his hair shaggy.  He travels light, carrying only a backpack with some food and clothes, and a thin dwarven dagger at his waist.  His eyes are bright and inquisitive, and his face seems to be fixed permenantly with an irreverent grin.
TINDR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Tindr grins.  "Gildi and Thengil are incredibly gifted - imagine what they could make together!"
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven bodyguard
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven bodyguard
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=After Skaal ascended as a young child to become leader of Stoneheim, he found that leaders and diplomats did not take him seriously, hiding smirks and grins as they talked with the boy-chief.  As a remedy, Skaal formed an elite band of bodyguards to stand by him and protect him.  Over the course of his life, this group has encompassed an elite group of warriors held in high esteem by the people of the mountain.  The bodyguards all wear heavy plate armour, their faces obscured by heavy helmets; only their long, braided hair is visible.  They each carry massive stone hammers, and stand, immobile, while their leader conducts his affairs.
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven bodyguard grunts.
PIERCING_EYE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=piercing eye
PIERCING_EYE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a piercing eye
PIERCING_EYE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A fiendish creature born of fire and magic, piercing eyes lurk in ruins and dungeons, deep in forests and far beneath the earth.  A burning, unblinking sphere in the shape of a massive eye, the piercing eye's flames cut through the strongest steel, searing the flesh beneath.  They have long been used by dungeon keepers as guardians for precious things, sent to lurk deep in the darkness before revealing themselves in an eruption of searing flame.
PIERCING_EYE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=You are transfixed by the piercing eye's burning gaze.
DEEP_CRAWLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=deep crawler
DEEP_CRAWLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a deep crawler
DEEP_CRAWLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive, centipede-like creatures, deep crawlers are terrifyingly quick insects that possess a potent venom.  They are typically found far beneath the world's surface, but occasionally make their way to the surface and into the fields and forests.  Due to their enormous size, they are greatly feared, and hunted down as soon as they are seen - perhaps for this reason they are known to be much more common in caves and caverns.
DEEP_CRAWLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The deep crawler clicks its mandibles in anticipation.
STONE_GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone golem
STONE_GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone golem
STONE_GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When making a golem, the traditional material is clay.  The pliability of clay allows the artificer to mold it into the rough shape of a man easily.  But for the more determined artificer, stone offers the possibility of an immensely strong golem - if the artificer can find a way to carve it.  Stone golems lumber about slowly, but are immensely strong, their thick, stone bodies augmented by the strong magics that bind them.
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=animated armour
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an animated armour
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought by some to be spirits inhabiting the mail of the dead, the creatures known as animated armours are actually constructs of the same family as the golem.  Working in tandem with a skilled smith, the artificer imbues the armour with powerful magic, allowing it to move, and attack.  Often armed with a halberd or long spear, these creations are often sent to guard something valuable, attacking mindlessly until the armour itself is damaged, releasing the magic and falling to pieces.
IRON_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=iron horror
IRON_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an iron horror
IRON_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Terrifying, flying creatures formed of molten iron, iron horrors blaze with an intense red-white glow.  Only documented recently, it is thought that they exist only at the center of the world, discovered when the gnomes and dwarves dug too deep.  Lacking the features of the overworld races - such as a fixed form - they speak not with mouths but telepathically, their strange language appearing unbidden in the mind.  And when they attack, they are utterly ferocious, destroying skin and bone with molten iron, leaving little more than a destroyed husk behind.
IRON_HORROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A voice appears in your mind, the words some sort of speech from beyond the stars.
HOLY_SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=holy shade
HOLY_SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a holy shade
HOLY_SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most holy men and women die, the bodies are buried or burned, the spirits ascending to the heavens to live with the Nine.  But the Nine have their unknowable ways, and some holy servants find their spirits bound to the earth, their service continuing into the next life.  These holy shades are granted great powers, able to bring divine wrath against the unholy and unbelieving, their spirit forms glowing with holy light.  These shades are often found near holy sites such as temples and churches, but many stalk the world elsewhere, their divine mission eternal and unknown.
HOLY_SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The holy shade opens its mouth, and you are greeted by a screeching rasp.
DIVINE_AVENGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=divine avenger
DIVINE_AVENGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a divine avenger
DIVINE_AVENGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shapeshifting, divine beings in service of the Nine, divine avengers appear as great, upright beasts or angelic creatures, wielding massive, holy blades.  Granted great speed by their deity, they are able to overwhelm all but the most powerful of creatures.  Records of divine avengers are rare; it is known that in the earliest recorded histories, some blessed armies were led with one at the fore, tearing through spearmen and bowman, cleaving armour and shield.  But since then, there have been few recorded sightings, and it is believed that this is because there have been no survivors to tell the tale.
DIVINE_AVENGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The divine avenger shimmers and shifts.
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=temple guardian
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a temple guardian
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Divine beings towering over giants and trolls and even titans, temple guardians are nigh-invincible, protected by almost a foot of steel.  They wield massive-two handed hammers, the heads of which are covered with spikes and runes.  Temple guardians are tasked by the Nine with guarding their most important churches, temples, and sites of death, a task which these unspeaking, eternal beings perform ceaselessly.
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The temple guardian's expression is indiscernible beneath its visor.
LICH_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lich king
LICH_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lich king
LICH_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the most dangerous and terrifying of the corporeal undead, the lich king is the unholy and animated remnants of a great sorceror.  Granted life eternal by black magic, these creatures remain trapped in a state between death and life: able to see without eyes, move without muscles.  Mostly skeletal, but with bits of flesh hanging off the bones, lich kings wear tattered clothing and robes, their skeletal hands clutching gnarled wooden staves that glow in unearthly light.  Wielding deep magics against the living, it is said that their touch can poison, slow, even petrify their victims, and it is for this reason that lich kings are deeply feared.
LICH_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lich king hisses, "Hwaet! Yrthling, saecild, nu lifgreota!"
HOLLOW_MAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hollow man
HOLLOW_MAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hollow man
HOLLOW_MAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The festering undead, hollow men are corpses bound together by powerful magic.  Their skeletons and organs rotted long ago, they are filled with vile, venomous insects.  The touch of a hollow man is intensely acidic, eating at armour and weapons, disfiguring the skin beneath.  Like most undead, they are speechless, but those who have tried have been greeted by swarms of flies, wasps, and scarabs escaping from within.
HOLLOW_MAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hollow man opens his putrid mouth, releasing a cloud of insects.
GLICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Glich
GLICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Glich
GLICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A traveller who made her way to Carcassia from the mountain elf villages surrounding Atua-Elar, Telia came to study wizardry at the schools of magic.  While there, she inadvisedly recited from a spellbook far beyond her ability, and its magic permanently took hold.  Her form now fades in and out of reality, flickering, appearing as bursts of sudden light.  This has led to her nickname around town, "Glich", a pun, a glitching of "Glitch" that she finds none too funny.
GLICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Glich exclaims, "I'd advise against sketching me!"
GLICH_GIFT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Glich grumbles.  "Ever since my mini magical mishap, people around town don't like me hanging around.  So I go for rambles around the island."
GLICH_GIFT_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=Glich pulls something out of her rucksack, and tosses it to you.  "Here!  I have extra."
TELA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tela
TELA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tela
TELA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An attractive young woman with a close-cut bob and an oversized set of plate-and-leather armour, Tela runs an ambitious adventuring operation out of The Floundering Catfish in Carcassia.  Relying on itinerant adventurers to do much of the legwork (and provide cover from the Carcassian authorities), she collects all manner of strange and interesting trinkets, providing hungry young explorers with a decent cut of the profits.  She hides her iron will behind a soft exterior, charming everyone around her with her huge eyes, and happy, lilting voice.
TELA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Tela salutes you.  "Good day, adventurer!"
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_PREREQ_SID=Tela laughs.  "I appreciate your enthusiasm, adventurer, but you haven't even made a kill!"
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_START_SID="Welcome, adventurer!" Tela says. "My name is Tela, and I coordinate some exploratory operations in these parts."
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_START2_SID="I've been running into some issues lately.  The dungeons are getting more dangerous - I'm sure you've experienced it!"
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_START3_SID="Slay a score of your first kill, and I'll make sure you're appropriately compensated."
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Settling a Score
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kill a score of your first kill.
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="A score of your first kill, adventurer!"
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Tela beams.  "The dungeons should be safer, now!  Here's a little something for your efforts."
TELA_CREATURES_QUEST_UNIQUE_SID=Tela breaks into a huge smile.  "They've been causing me trouble for quite some time.  Thank you!"
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_START_SID="Adventurer, something terrible has been happening recently.  Three times I've sent people to the north-east, three times they've vanished."
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_START2_SID="Local trackers say they've heard tell of a snakeling named Serat, a murderous thug lurking deep within that dungeon."
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_START3_SID="My last ask is a large one: eliminate him.  Be very careful.  They say he loves company and poisons."
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Problem to the North
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find and destroy the murderer Serat in the north-east dungeon.
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Serat lurks at the bottom of the dungeon on the northern penninsula.  Eliminate him!"
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Tela laughs.  "Oh, well done!  I'll be honest: I wasn't sure you were up to it.  But, here you are...how about that!"
TELA_SERAT_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="You've more than proven yourself.  Take these for my gratitude, and consider yourself a full partner in my operations!"
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_START_SID=Tela says, "I broke my arm a little while ago fleeing from the guards.  It's healing nicely, but still isn't a hundred percent."
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_START2_SID="My armour's getting dented, rusted up, you name it.  I want to improve it, but to do that, I need to get some iron ingots for the forge."
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_START3_SID="That's where you come in!  You can dig through the walls in the dungeon.  Mostly you get rubble, but sometimes there's nicer things."
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_START4_SID="Bring me a few iron ingots.  Take these - they'll help you get started."
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Go to the Dungeon Ingot Started
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring Tela three iron ingots.
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Three iron ingots!  I don't have any use for steel right now."
TELA_INGOT_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="Excellent, adventurer, nicely done.  Hey, this washed up recently.  It's seaworthy.  Why don't you take it?"
OLD_HARGIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Old Hargin
OLD_HARGIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Old Hargin
OLD_HARGIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Part sailor, part magician, Old Hargin left the mountains around Atua-Elar to travel to the central lands to earn his staff.  Once he did so, he largely finished with magic.  Falling in love with the ocean, he soon forgot the great summoning and evocation magics and focused primarily on windmaking, that ancient art scoffed at as cantrip but beloved by every sailor on the sea.  Hopping from ship to ship, he explored much of the world over many centuries, making his own simple maps and histories, and now lives out his twilight years in Carcassia, his constellations finally fixed in place.
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Old Hargin takes a drink of his brown ale, and pauses.
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=Old Hargin says, "There's an interesting island at the south-east corner of the world, full of barbarians.  Friendly enough, though."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=Old Hargin says, "I heard years ago about a coup of a royal house out in the reaches, and that the prince and princess were cast out to sea."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID=Old Hargin says, "At the corners of the earth are ancient shrines.  Steer clear.  They're the kind of places where dragons would fear to tread."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID=Old Hargin says, "The Carcassian Empire is old, but not so old.  One day, its descendents will live in exile like the fae do now."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID=Old Hargin says, "In my travels, I found a dungeon and a sewer system that seemed to go down forever.  I never found their bottom."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID=Old Hargin says, "Keep stock of your potions and wands, and stay in good standing with the divine.  Never be afraid to pray."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID=Old Hargin says, "There is a lake in the far north-west - The Caldera - that is a gateway to the land of the dead."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID=Old Hargin says, "It seems like half the inscriptions in the dungeons are garbage, but the other half are actually good advice."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID=Old Hargin says, "I've spent so much time travelling I can't even remember the great peaks of Atua-Elar that watch the world from the south."
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT11_SID=Old Hargin says, "If you want to join the high tower, there's a witch in the old town who knows a few spells.  Maybe you can help her out?"
OLD_HARGIN_SPEECH_TEXT12_SID=Old Hargin says, "Can't read?  Maybe one of the great wizards could help you with that."
FFLEUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ffleur
FFLEUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ffleur
FFLEUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young man in his mid-twenties, Fleur hails from the craggy northern islands outside the reaches of the Carcassian Empire.  Broad-built, with thick, corded arms, he looks every bit oarsman that he used to be.  An ugly goblin mace hangs from his waist, something taken from the depths of a dungeon he returns to continually, one which he claims runs to the centre of the earth and further, eternal, unyielding, unending.
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ffleur says, "When I grew up, I had this nagging sense that there was something not quite right with me, with my placement in the world."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="While the other children laughed and played, I withdrew into the countryside - the low forests, the clifflands and hillsides."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="When I was sixteen, I hitched a ride on a freight ship.  Worked the oars.  Day after day I said nothing but saw many things."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID="In the far southeast there's an island shaped like a cross.  In the center, an old dungeon, strange sounds echoing from its depths."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID="I've spent years exploring that place.  Mapping the strange twists, the stairways that dart and vanish.  Every time, it's different."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID="Over the years, I've looked for patterns, but found none.  A strange magic arranges that place.  And each time, I push deeper."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID="At first I wondered if there was an to end those passages.  If there is I can't find it, fumbling in the low light, choking on the poor air."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID="For some of us, the city is a burden, full of laws and rules.  The best life has darkness and quiet, torchlight and shadow."
FFLEUR_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID="It's strange, adventurer, but when I'm lost in the depths, blind and hungry and alone, I finally feel at peace with the world."
CALABUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Calabus
CALABUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Calabus
CALABUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Originally a hot-headed spearman from a rocky islet at the eastern edge of the empire, Calabus came to Carcassia to make his name, and chose the life-or-death of the fighting pits.  His final fight was against a captured ogre chieftain; but after Calabus won, spearing the ogre on a massive pike, he decided to travel, sailing around the world before finally settling down in Carcassia.  The oldest living member of the Order Ex Gladiatores, Calabus lives a simple life on the outskirts of the city.  Unable to have children himself, and his wife having passed years ago, he tends a small flock of sheep, coming into the city proper to tend to the blind oracle's needs.  They have an odd relationship: he never asked her permission, or even introduced himself; and she never speaks to, or acknowledges him.  But every week, he comes to scythe the tall grass, tend to her trees, and leaves her a little smoked mutton and beer outside her hut.
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Calabus nods. "Yes, I am Calabus - pride of Urin, Order Ex Gladiatores, The Spearman and The Ogre-Slayer."
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="After I ran my pike through the chest of Ghaghur the Black, and earned the emperor's appreciation, I decided to see what was outside the empire."
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="At the corners of the world I found strange shrines, shrouded by choking mists and full of strange and monstrous creatures."
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID="I barely got away with my life, and what I saw there still finds me before sleep, open-mouthed, rot-breathed, waiting to take me to my dreams."
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID="I sailed back to Carcassia, and settled down.  I married.  I had no children.  Three years ago, my Ilsie took ill and died."
CALABUS_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID="I live a simple life now.  I tend my sheep, and the blind oracle's dwelling.  It's not glamorous, but it's safe.  I'm happy.  And that's enough."
SERAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Serat
SERAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Serat
SERAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Even among a people noted for behaviour ranging from antisocial to sociopathic, Serat makes his home at the margins.  Having stowed away on a small scow out of the Snake Lands, he then murdered the captain and used the proceeds from the freight to hire a group of like-minded thugs.  Holed up in the old dungeon on the Isle of Carcassia, they waylay those seek to explore its depths, lining their coffers with piles of bloody ivory.
SERAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Serat hisses and inches closer.
GUILDMASTER_CARO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Guildmaster Caro
GUILDMASTER_CARO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Guildmaster Caro
GUILDMASTER_CARO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A middle aged man, Guildmaster Caro is very tall - close to seven feet - and built like an ox.  He wears green-brown clothing stained with dirt and what could be blood, and the corners of his mouth extend in either direction, a pair of hideous scars given to him at some point in the past.  Despite his lumbering size, he is quick, very quick, his body poised in a kind of half crouch, his hands affected by some sort of twitch and always resting idle near his knives.
GUILDMASTER_CARO_INTRO_SID=Guildmaster Caro eyes you up and down.  "You want to join the Guild of Thieves?  Then you're going to have to commit to a life outside the law."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_INTRO2_SID="Break your moral conducts - every one of them - and then we can talk."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_THIEF_SID=Guildmaster Caro grins.  "You seem like my kind of person.  I appreciate those who look to improve themselves by any means!"
GUILDMASTER_CARO_NOBLE_SID=Guildmaster Caro laughs.  "I steal, and you call me a thief; you steal, and you call it government!"
GUILDMASTER_CARO_CANNOT_JOIN_SID=Guildmaster Caro shakes his head.  "You can never be one of us.  You made your choice.  Get out."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_JOIN_PROMPT_SID=Guildmaster Caro says, "Are you ready to join the Carcassian Guild of Thieves?"
GUILDMASTER_CARO_JOIN_ACCEPT_SID="Then welcome, adventurer, to the underworld!"
GUILDMASTER_CARO_JOIN_DECLINE_SID=Guildmaster Caro gives you a heavy pat on the back.  "Come back if you change your mind!"

GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Within the Way Without
GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find a way through the hidden room in the Public District.
GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="Impressive, adventurer.  Most of these dumb lugs aren't so resourceful.  I'll teach you a little about disarming traps..."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_QUEST_COMPLETE_THIEVERY_SID="Impressive, adventurer.  Most of these dumb lugs aren't so resourceful.  I'll teach you a little about thievery..."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SKELETON_KEY_SID="I have nothing to teach; you're far beyond my learning.  Take this - I found it in my younger days.  It will surely be a help."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_HIDDEN_ROOM_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="You can't dig, either with muscle or magic.  You'll have to find another way in!"
GUILDMASTER_CARO_DISARM_TRAPS_START_SID=Caro looks about sadly.  "This place is going to shambles.  I mean, it's a hovel, but it could be so much more."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_DISARM_TRAPS_START2_SID="In the Temple District there's a vault where the Empire stores its gold and ivory.  It's well-guarded, and trapped."
GUILDMASTER_CARO_DISARM_TRAPS_START3_SID="Get rid of the trap at the doorway, and I'll make sure you're rewarded."

CARCASSIAN_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carcassian guard
CARCASSIAN_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a Carcassian guard
CARCASSIAN_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The day to day business of policing, both in Carcassia itself as well as the outposts of the empire, falls to the Carcassian guard.  Drawn from volunteer citizens, the guard provides a stable enough income for its members to live a simple life.  Trained from a young age in the law and in combat, the guard provides a measure of protection to its citizens, while serving as a symbol of the empire itself.  The guards are dressed in mail-coats given some sort of treatment to shimmer under the smallest light.  Their surcoats bear the arms of the empire, and they themselves carry wicked, jagged spears.
CARCASSIAN_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Carcassian guard hails you.

GAMBLER_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=The gambler says, "Pov is cheap, but the odds are bad.  Save up and play some blackjack instead."
GAMBLER_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=The gambler says, "I wouldn't try anything funny.  This house doesn't have bouncers because it doesn't need them."
GAMBLER_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID=The gambler says, "My wife left and my dog hates me, but I've got a pocket full of ivory and a real good feeling!"
GAMBLER_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID=The gambler says, "I hear the emperor allows the gambling houses because they keep from having to raise taxes."
POV_DEALER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pov dealer
POV_DEALER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pov dealer
POV_DEALER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Pov is a simple dice game, its rules standardized around the world.  The bettor makes a bet on the roll of a die.  If that number comes up, they win triple their money.  The odds aren't great, but pov tends to be a game played for small amounts of money, usually an ivory or two.  The origin of the name is obscure, but it's thought that "pov" is appropriately, short for "poverty".
POV_DEALER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pov dealer asks, "Game of pov?  Two ivories to buy in, six if you win!"
POV_DEALER_NSF_MESSAGE_SID=The pov dealer says, "You'll need at least two ivories to play!"
POV_DEALER_DECLINE_MESSAGE_SID=The pov dealer says, "Come back anytime!  You just might get lucky."
POV_DEALER_WHICH_NUMBER_SID=The pov dealer calls your name.  "What number you got?" 
POV_DEALER_INVALID_VALUE_SID=The pov dealer looks at you scornfully, and tosses back your money.  "That's not helpful.  If you need help counting, let me know."
POV_DEALER_ROLLING_SID=The pov dealer bounces a die around the table
DEALER_WIN_SID=You win! You collect your winnings.
DEALER_LOSE_SID=You lose! Better luck next time.
BLACKJACK_DEALER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackjack dealer
BLACKJACK_DEALER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackjack dealer
BLACKJACK_DEALER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A popular game among the middle class, blackjack is played between the player and the dealer, with the objective being to get a higher score than the dealer without going over 21.  It can be played with any number of players, though some gambling houses limit the number of players to prevent collusion.  Blackjack is popular among merchants and sailors, who in past centuries spread it around the world while moving their goods.
BLACKJACK_DEALER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blackjack dealer looks at you.  "This table has a fifty ivory buy-in."
BLACKJACK_DEALER_NSF_MESSAGE_SID=The blackjack dealer says, "Come back when you're a little less broke."
BLACKJACK_DEALER_DECLINE_MESSAGE_SID=The blackjack dealer nods, and deals in the players around you.

BLACKJACK_DEALER_WIN_SID=Dealer wins!
RACEMASTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=racemaster
RACEMASTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the racemaster
RACEMASTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=For reasons that are completely unknown, there is a small racing track outside the casino in Carcassia - but instead of horses, griffins, or something similar, the Carcassians race turtles.  And not the large, leatherback turtles, who can actually propel themselves reasonably quickly; no, just whatever little turtles they find in the ponds and lakes around the city.  The racemasters have almost always been gnomes, who seem to have a fondness for the resilient little reptiles.
RACEMASTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The racemaster exclaims, "Extreme snapping turtle races!  Action and mayhem at 1km/hr!"
CARCASSIA_TURTLE_RACES=Carcassia Turtle Track
CARCASSIA_TURTLE_FINISH=%s wins!
RACEMASTER_MISSING_TURTLES_SID=The racemaster furrows his brow.  "That's odd.  They're not all here..."
RACEMASTER_DECLINE_SID=The racemaster says, "Come back when you want to shell out for some excitement!"
RACEMASTER_BET_SID="Double your bet if you win!  How much do you want to wager?" 
RACEMASTER_RACE_RUNNING_SID=The racemaster says, "No more bets until the current race is done!"
RACEMASTER_NONSENSE_SID=The racemaster rolls his eyes.
SNAPPING_TURTLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snapping turtle
SNAPPING_TURTLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snapping turtle
SNAPPING_TURTLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the larger varieties of turtle, the snapping turtle is a freshwater creature known for its thick shell and quick, mobile head.  Its jaws can unhinge and open quite wide, and its quick, snapping bite give it its name.  They mostly feed on plants and insects, but more than one person has lost a finger from cajoling them while out of the water.
SNAPPING_TURTLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snapping turtle lunges at you!
HEDGE_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hedge wizard
HEDGE_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hedge wizard
HEDGE_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=True magic is beyond the reach of most, but it's said that cantrips can be taught to anyone who can read.  Hedge wizards and witches learn simple charms to influence coming weather, heal scrapes, and summon bits of flame.  Wizards and priests claim that this is not real magic, but given the popularity of hedge magicians in remote communities, the world would beg to differ.  While wizards are hunched over their stacks of scrolls, and priests plot new ways to separate folk from their earthly possessions, hedge mages are out living in the real world, making a measurable difference in the lives of the weakest, the meekest, the poorest.
HEDGE_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hedge wizard summons a handful of chaotic, dancing lights.
HEDGE_WIZARD_CANTRIPS_SID=The hedge wizard says, "You want to learn cantrips, and I need three thousand ivory to build a house for me and my family.  Is it a deal?"
HEDGE_WIZARD_CANTRIPS_ACCEPT_SID=The hedge wizard teaches you the basics of cantrips, and hands you a poorly-copied text.
HEDGE_WIZARD_CANTRIPS_DECLINE_SID=The hedge wizard says, "Come back if you change your mind!"
HEDGE_WIZARD_NSF_SID=The hedge wizard says, "It'll be three thousand ivory if you want to learn magic with me!"
HEDGE_WIZARD_LITERACY_SID=The hedge wizard laughs, "I can't teach you cantrips if you can't read!  Talk to the tutor in the Fellowship temple, south-east from here."
TEMPLE_TUTOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=temple tutor
TEMPLE_TUTOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a temple tutor
TEMPLE_TUTOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Fellowship of the Nine is a religious organization devoted to the promotion of the divine, and while their primary mission revolves around the promotion of organized religion, they perform a nunber of other important tasks.  One of these is to teach people how to read and write.  On the Fellowship's missions, they send not only priests and holy texts, but also education primers, textbooks, chalkboards, paper, and quills.  The teaching methods are said to be heavy on the heavenly, but those who have enrolled in their courses have spoken of the power of the written word, and of the importance of literacy in making a better life.
TEMPLE_TUTOR_LITERACY_SID=The temple tutor says, "So, you want to learn to read.  Will you make a donation of two thousand ivory to the Fellowship?"
TEMPLE_TUTOR_LITERACY_ACCEPT_SID=The temple tutor says, "Let's begin.  This is the letter 'A', which you can remember as resembling a steeple..."
TEMPLE_TUTOR_LITERACY_DECLINE_SID=The temple tutor shrugs.  "I'm not going to read too much into this, and I suppose you won't either."
TEMPLE_TUTOR_NSF_SID=The temple tutor says, "If you'd like to learn to read, you're going to need to make a donation to the Fellowship - two thousand ivory should do it."
TEMPLE_TUTOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The temple tutor looks up from her parchment.
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gardening spellstudent
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gardening spellstudent
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The youngest students of the tower are put to work doing seemingly menial work: planting flowers, weeding the beds and window planters, and cutting the grass.  Though generations of budding wizards have complained bitterly about the work, it serves an important purpose: learning, at a very slow and basic level, how things grow, and how they come back.  This is what the masters tell the students, at least.  Secretly, they would say that the real reason is so that the tower doesn't have to pay for gardeners.
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gardening spellstudent stands up slowly, and wipes a bead of sweat.
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_FLOWER_TEXT_SID=The gardening spellstudent says, "This is backbreaking work, and I'm tired of it!  Alakansch beyari!"
GARDENING_SPELLSTUDENT_FLOWER_TEXT2_SID=It feels like time begins to slow: you see some flowers sprout and grow.
SUMMONINGS_STUDENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=summonings student
SUMMONINGS_STUDENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a summonings student
SUMMONINGS_STUDENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Lost for many years, the art of summoning has recently made a resurgence.  Described in texts buried deep in the libraries of the tower, the language is a bizarre combination of runic and pictographs.  It is a dangerous and fraught form of magic, and those who study it need to be able to withstand the physical rigors of a spell gone awry.  Perhaps for this reason, it is most popular among the ogres and giants at the school.
SUMMONINGS_STUDENT_TRADE_SID=The summonings student says, "For ten magici shards, I'll trade you a golden apple."
TOWER_STUDENT_ACCEPT_SID="Here you are!"
TOWER_STUDENT_SHRUG_SID=The student shrugs, and goes back to work.
TOWER_STUDENT_DEFAULT_SID=The student looks up from a well-worn spellbook.  "I'm busy.  Please leave me alone."
RUNIC_STUDENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=runic student
RUNIC_STUDENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a runic student
RUNIC_STUDENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among scholars with no magical training, runic is thought to be a dead, fixed language in which magical texts are written.  And while it does cover the most powerful magics - cantrips being written in day to day languages - it is by no means set in stone.  The language itself has evolved over time, and still does, as new texts are written.  Students of the language play an important role at the tower, acting as scribes and interpreters, preserving and helping to illuminate ancient, rotting texts.
RUNIC_STUDENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The runic student grimaces and mumbles, tripping over strange, uncertain sounds.
RUNIC_STUDENT_TRADE_SID=The runic student says, "For three blank scrolls, I'll trade you an unstoning potion."
ENCHANTMENTS_STUDENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=enchantments student
ENCHANTMENTS_STUDENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=an enchantments student
ENCHANTMENTS_STUDENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In simplest terms, enchantment is the process of imbuing something with magic.  This can include things such as scrolls and spellbooks, weapons and armour, but also takes other strange forms.  One game particularly enjoyed by students is the process of voice-swapping - trading voices with someone else, or even doing this to a pair of animals.  Legend tells of a favourite sheepdog at the local tavern that didn't bark, but hooted like a barn owl.  The owl was never found.
ENCHANTMENTS_STUDENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The enchantments student hails you brightly.
ENCHANTMENTS_STUDENT_TRADE_SID=The enchantments student says, "For three magici shards, I'll trade you an ether potion."
EVOCATIONS_STUDENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=evocations student
EVOCATIONS_STUDENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=an evocations student
EVOCATIONS_STUDENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Evocations is the process of drawing out magic, and often takes the form of summoning wreaths of fire, calling down lightning, or summoning terrifying ice storms.  Besides being flashy, these sorts of magics serve a real need in a violent, uncertain world.  Wizards who focus on evocations are in great demand, particularly in the more lawless parts of the outer reaches, where raiders and pirates roam the coasts, and dragons soar overhead.
EVOCATIONS_STUDENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The evocations student greets you.
EVOCATIONS_STUDENT_TRADE_SID=The evocations student says, "For ten blank scrolls, I'll trade you a silver apple."
GOLGOA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Golgoa
GOLGOA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Golgoa
GOLGOA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the mid-south, there are large numbers of tropical islands.  Most of these are very small, barely larger than sandbars, but some are large enough to support settlement.  And at some point in the past, raft-folk stopped off and made their home underneath the mango and papaya trees.  Golgoa comes from these islands.  He learned the art of windworking from basic principles, and sailed to the central lands to study at the high tower.  Shuttering himself in the carrels and subsisting on a diet of fruit and wellwater, he quickly outpaced the other students.  The masters recognized the deep abilities he possessed, and shortly made the young man one of their own.
GOLGOA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Golgoa stops carving his wand, and waits for you to speak.
GOLGOA_GIFT_TEXT_SID=Golgoa nods.  "Welcome to the high tower.  I am no oracle, but I can see something about you - fire and rage, and the cold north-west islands."
GOLGOA_GIFT_TEXT2_SID="I will teach you a little of what I know.  The great evocations are your best chance to survive against the things that come for you."
GOLGOA_GIFT_TEXT3_SID=You feel an explosion of pure magical knowledge in your mind.
LORELEI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lorelei
LORELEI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lorelei
LORELEI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Hailing from one of the wood elf tribes of the deep and ancient forests, Lorelei came to the tower in middle age.  She speaks little of her past, only that she was a weaver with no magical inclination, and had some sort of experience, deep in the lightless woods, that changed that.  And though she showed a great deal of aptitude in the linguistics of runic, her true ability is with enchantment: her wands hum with powerful magics, her swords cleave through stone, and her own clothing, made on a well-worn loom, seems to shimmer of its own will under the light.
LORELEI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lorelei catches a passing butterfly on her staff.
LORELEI_GIFT_TEXT_SID=Lorelei looks up proudly.  "A new student!  And so well-travelled, too.  It feels as if you might need a bit of help in the days ahead."
LORELEI_GIFT_TEXT2_SID="Take this potion, and this wand.  And good luck."
LORELEI_LITERACY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lorelei says, "We have felt faint tremors - far to the south east, at the corner of the world, a small magic has been released."
LORELEI_LITERACY_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID="I once had a student from that island, the witch Cynwise.  She was kind, I remember, and very capable."
LORELEI_LITERACY_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID="We both know you cannot read a word.  Perhaps Cynwise could help you get started.  And the temple has a tutor who could help, too."
OKHOA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Okhoa
OKHOA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Okhoa
OKHOA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Unspeaking, unblinking, Okhoa was cast out of their tribe for a certain keenness with primordial magic.  Making their way to Carcassia, they found a home in the high tower.  Never speaking, communicating only through writing, Okhoa took to runic as if already fluent, and in a few short years became the foremost expert in the difficulties of that ancient script.  Hidden away on the top floor of the tower, they delve into the ancient texts unreadable by every other, mastering strange magics left over from an age before recorded time.
OKHOA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Okhoa fixes their attention on you, but says nothing.
OKHOA_KEY_TEXT_SID=Okhoa says nothing, but reaches into their robe.  Pulling out a small, iron key, they press it in your palm.
SCHELDT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Scheldt
SCHELDT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Scheldt
SCHELDT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The head of the high tower, Scheldt is very old and frail - his pallid skin stretched thin, his hair falling down in loose strands from beneath his hood.  But though his body is beginning to fail, his mind is very much in place.  The youngest son of a fishing family, he left the open seas to come to Carcassia to study great magics - magics he learned from the hedge witches on his island, who taught him to calm the coastal waters and sustain plants in a drought.  Once at the tower, he progressed slowly.  But where others plateaued, he pushed further and further, learning the great evocations, summoning torrents of fire and calling meteors from the sky.  Now an old man, his time is almost done.  By wisps of were-light, he hunches over his small desk through the night, reading the old histories, the ancient poems, preparing for his life in the world beyond.
SCHELDT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Scheldt hails you with a brief wave.
SCHELDT_INITIATE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Scheldt looks up from his reading.  "If you wish to join the high tower, you'll need to show some kind of aptitude for magic."
SCHELDT_THIEVES_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Scheldt looks at you coldly.  "You threw in your lot with Caro and his thugs.  Get out."
SCHELDT_JOIN_PROMPT_SID="So," murmurs Scheldt, "I understand you wish to join the high tower?"
SCHELDT_JOIN_ACCEPT_SID="Then welcome.  Here is your robe and staff.  To begin your journey, talk to the other three masters in the tower."
SCHELDT_JOIN_DECLINE_SID=Scheldt grimaces.  "Pity.  You have some promise.  Let me know if you reconsider."
LISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lish
LISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lish
LISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Hedge-witch, witch-woman, herb-eater, Black Lish: the number of nicknames given by the people of Carcassia to the young woman is staggering.  Living at the fringes of Old Town, she gathers herbs and digs for magici around the dungeons that dot the town.  And because of this solitary lifestyle, the people of Carcassia give her their scorn.  Over time, she adapted to the insults, dying her blonde hair black, worshipping the long-passed forest spirits, and calling up her cantrips and small magics against those who'd do her harm.
LISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lish stares through you with her startling, steel-blue eyes.
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_START_SID=Lish says, "I've been going further afield in search of silver apples.  But I can only carry so much food along with everything else."
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_START2_SID="Silverweed will fill you up completely, and weighs almost nothing.  But it's rare.  Could you find some for me?"
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Lish breaks into a huge, crooked smile.  "Thank you!  Everyone here is so awful.  It's nice to meet someone who'll simply help."
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=She leans in and gives you a quick hug.  "Here, I'll teach you some beginner magics..."
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Silverweed
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find four silverweed plants for Lish.
LISH_SILVERWEED_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Four silverweed plants!  That should keep me satisfied for days."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_START_SID=Lish speaks softly, her voice quavering.  "I've been seeing someone.  Her name is Calara.  She makes me laugh; she's so lovely."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_START2_SID="We were supposed to meet last night, beyond the city walls.  We had arranged to meet by the west gate, but she just never showed up."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_START3_SID="Please find out what happened to her!  I don't know what I'd do without her."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Lovers in a Dangerous Time
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find out what happened to Lish's lover, Calara.
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Please find out what happened to Calara!  We were supposed to meet by the west gate, but she never showed."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Lish drops to her knees, and a whispery shriek quickly turns into an ear-splitting wail.
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=She takes the tattered cloak, soaked through with blood, and presses it against her chest.
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="She was so perfect, adventurer!  Don't you see?  There will never be others.  There will only ever be, can only ever be her."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID="She was my centre.  She grounded me.  She held me and I held her, and nothing else mattered."
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE5_SID=Lish pauses to wipe her tears.  Three times she tries to speak, three times she fails.  She gathers herself, and slowly finds the words.
LISH_LOVER_QUEST_COMPLETE6_SID="This was her prized possession.  It was her beacon in the dark, her way home to me.  It's no good to me, now.  Use it well."
ASHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Asher
ASHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Asher
ASHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elderly, bent double by a bad spine, Asher is a well-known ascetic of Celeste.  Rejecting a normal life in his youth, he sailed a small skiff to an islet north of Carcassia, a rocky place with a clear, cold spring.  Bringing with him his mason's tools, he first excavated a small crevice in the cliffside.  And then, over the course of the summer, he expanded it, hauling out more and more stone, digging himself a place of rest and reflection.  The first winter, he lived on wild root vegetables and speared fish.  And then over dozens of years, he dug and shaped the stone into a small, open-roofed church, worshipping his goddess under sun and rain, wind and snow.  This existence was recently interrupted by goblin raiders - he sighted them late one evening, their ships alight with dozens of torches, barely giving him enough time to scramble south to Carcassia before they arrived.
ASHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Asher tips his staff to you in greeting.
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Holy Island
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_START_SID="It's so sad, adventurer," says Asher.  "After a lifetime of reflective, quiet worship, I was set upon by a goblin raiding party."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_START2_SID="They came out of the north in several ships, and so quickly, too.  I barely had time to grab my skiff and sail to Carcassia."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_START3_SID="I live alone on a small islet, just north of here.  Those goblins have now made camp within the church I dedicated to Holy Celeste."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_START4_SID="Eliminate them, every single one.  This will be an act of great righteousness in the eyes of the Nine."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Eliminate all the goblins on Asher's Islet, north of the Isle of Carcassia.
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Look for a small, rocky islet, with high cliffs.  Then you'll have found my home."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Asher smiles, and his bent, weary body relaxes.  "Killing is not something I enjoy.  You have, however, done a holy service."
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=Asher's face turns serious, and he begins chanting in an older dialect.  The words are crisp and short, somewhat musical in their effect.
ASHER_ISLET_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID=You are bathed in an intense holy light, and feel favoured by the divine.
AKHRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akhra
AKHRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akhra
AKHRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of a small goblin raiding party, Akhra's crews sail around the outlying islands, harassing other ships and typically raiding small fishing villages.  Numbering a few dozen in total, the raiders are unprepared to raid or lay siege to larger towns, or even deal with a number of nearby villages banding together.  So they attack quickly, loosing a hail of stones and fire-bombs to create panic.  Akhra himself is unremarkable: ugly, skinny, not particularly strong.  He is, however, sociopathic, and earned his place by killing everyone who opposed him with his short, spiked mace.
AKHRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Akhra spits at you, and raises his ugly mace.
AXANDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Axander
AXANDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Axander
AXANDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Head of the religious Fellowship of the Nine, an organization devoted to the promotion of religion in everyday life, Axander seems every bit suited to his role.  Tall, stiff-backed, he looks out with an expression that's equal parts stern and caring.  A former priest of Aurelion, he left his position as a preacher to serve as a religious ambassador.  And after travelling throughout the world, he settled back in Carcassia, tending to the administration and direction of his order.
AXANDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Axander nods his head in greeting.
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Stolen Spellbook
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find the missing spellbook stolen from the Fellowship in Carcassia.
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_START_SID="Welcome to the Fellowship of the Nine!" exclaims the holy man in front of you.  "My name is Axander."
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_START2_SID="We keep a small lending library for acolytes of all faiths.  It's a modest collection, but an essential service in dangerous world."
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_START3_SID="Recently, a young urchin stole one of our books.  None of us can find hide nor hair of him.  Could you help us get our book?"
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="Thank you!" exclaims Axander.  "It's not a lot, but I hope this will help defray some of the costs of your adventuring."
AXANDER_SPELLBOOK_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Look for the little scabby orphan.  Yes, I realize this describes half the children of the city."
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_START_SID="Adventurer, come quickly!  Vorogil, a servant of the black god, has been spotted near the blind oracle!"
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_START2_SID="He thinks nothing of preying on the weak and helpless.  The path to the oracle is now cursed, a way of blood and gore."
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_START3_SID="The city guards are bought, blind to his presence.  I am appealing to you - find him, and end the murder."
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Axander breathes a sigh of relief.  "Thank you.  We will all sleep better knowing that monster's been put to rest."
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="The high tower sends a token of their appreciation, and the Fellowship hopes this ivory will help as well."
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_TITLE_SID=A Knife in the Dark
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find Vorogil near the dwelling of the blind oracle, and put an end to his murderous ways.
AXANDER_VOROGIL_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Vorogil lurks near the dwelling of the blind oracle, east of here, near the city walls."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Bog Body
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Retrieve of the body of Talmai of Carcassia from the marshlands of Sithrin.
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_START_SID="The Snakelings were created by the sorceror Zaeda, and many participate in his cult, venerating him as a god, rejecting the Nine."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_START2_SID="Last year, we sent Talmai to establish a temple in the Snakelings' capital, Sithrin, with the hopes of extinguishing the cult."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_START3_SID="The Snakelings sent a response - Talmai's head, his tongue cut out, a serpent sewn in its place."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_START4_SID="Their capital is in marshlands, far north-east of here.  Return his body to us, so his spirit may have some peace."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Axander summons a pair of acolytes, who delicately take the body from you, and begin to prepare it for burial.
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Talmai was a good man," says Axander, "and no good man deserves to bleed out in a bog at the edge of the world."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="Your actions are righteous and just.  You are therefore now one of us, and walk in the divine presence of the Nine."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID="Do not be afraid to pray in your time of need: you will find they are most receptive to your prayers."
AXANDER_SITHRIN_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Sithrin can be found in a vast, wet lowland," says Axander, "at the very north-eastern tip of the world."
VOROGIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vorogil
VOROGIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vorogil
VOROGIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In his early life, Vorogil lived on a small island at the edge of the Carcassian empire.  Like many youths, he spent time exploring the old ruins and dungeons that littered the landscape.  But one day, deep in a long-forgotten sewer, he found something that should have remained hidden: an ancient stone of great magic, through which dread Sceadugenga spoke to him from the cold edges of the cosmos.  Taken in by dark promises, Vorogil became a follower of the ancient horror.  His forehead bleeds from an unspeakable rune.  He speaks in tongues, back-and-forth between a series of lost languages.  And having become so practiced in the taking of lives, it's said that a thrust of his knife will find its way through any armour, whether cloth, leather, wood, or steel.
VOROGIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Vorogil's lips curl into a smile, and a black rune on his forehead bleeds and bleeds.
WART_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wart
WART_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wart
WART_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, snot-nosed, scabby child, Wart looks as if he'd make a noble recoil.  Barefoot, dressed in tattered clothing, he seems as if he'd spent his life sleeping in a gutter.  This is actually remarkably close to the truth: growing up orphaned and penniless, he spends his nights bedded down in the stables, literally asleep in dung and dirt and straw.
WART_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Wart says, "I'm hiding from the Fellowship!  I stole a book to pawn, but threw it down a well when they came looking for me."
BLIND_ORACLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blind oracle
BLIND_ORACLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=blind oracle
BLIND_ORACLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the priests of the Nine claim to have direct communion with their deities, in truth, they receive whispers, interpreting natural signs as confirmation or denial of their questions.  But as long as history has been recorded, there has been a divine oracle, chosen by the Nine to be their mouthpiece on the material world.  Always a woman, she is able to hear their voices directly, and sometimes speaks as them.  The rest of the time, she speaks of what they tell her in her own voice.  The current oracle, said to be as old as the Empire itself, is a fae, and incredibly old.  It's said that in the milk that covers her eyes one can see the Nine staring back.
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blind oracle stares at you with milky white eyes.
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=A celestial voice intones, "Blessed are those who sacrifice."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=A powerful voice says, "A great evil reaches from beneath the surface of the north-west corner of the world."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID=A sweet voice says, "There is no advancement through war or hate.  We can only find peace in love."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID=An earthy voice says, "In the end, with the passing of men, the islands will fuse again."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID=A draconic voice hisses, "A great evil sits trapped within its watery prison, held back by magics that must not be touched."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID=A low voice laughs, "We are the divine of this plane only; what you call demons are beyond our reach and ken."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID=A cold whisper says, "The Caldera is the gateway to the land of the dead."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID=A horrifying voice reaches into your mind: "I lie trapped beyond the cosmos, held by the command of your false gods.  Release me!"
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID=A bone-chilling roar tears through the room: "The first folk have hidden themselves from us!  Where?  Where?!"
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT11_SID=The blind oracle says, "I have been here before the Empire, and shall live beyond it, too."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT12_SID=The blind oracle says, "The oracles have come from all the races but the snakelings, who are too new to this world."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT13_SID=The blind oracle says, "The Nine speak through me: even the black devil himself!"
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT14_SID=The blind oracle says, "I have been gifted such long life; I remember a world of dragons, and yes, the place-that-was before."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT15_SID=The blind oracle says, "My body falls apart, my spirit soars - I will leave this world when the Nine are ready."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT16_SID=The blind oracle says, "Four brothers once swam the Caldera's dark waters, felt the underworld, and lived to tell the tale."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT17_SID=The blind oracle says, "Each of the Nine insist on a different set of behaviours."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT18_SID=The blind oracle says, "With the help of the Nine, you will be capable of great things."
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT19_SID=The blind oracle says, "The great continent of early history was shattered by the hand of Aurelion himself!"
BLIND_ORACLE_SPEECH_TEXT20_SID=The blind oracle says, "Many heroes think themselves great and unique, forgetting the names that came before."
PRAETOR_FOOTMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor's footman
PRAETOR_FOOTMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the Praetor's footman
PRAETOR_FOOTMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Head of the servants of the Praetor of Carcassia, the footman ensures that only invited guests make their way into the household of the Emperor's uncle.  In addition to acting as doorkeeper and face of the household, he is also responsible for acting as the Praetor's private secretary, arranging appointments and ensuring the Praetor's day is well-laid out and orderly.  The current footman is not part of the Carcassian nobility; instead, he is a commoner who retired as a captain of the Carcassian guard, with whispers around the capital that he was personally recommended by the Emperor himself.
PRAETOR_FOOTMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Praetor's footman nods at you stiffly.
PRAETOR_FOOTMAN_PROVIDE_KEY_SID=The Praetor's footman hands you a key.  "Please come in.  We're running into some problems today.  Perhaps you could be of assistance."
COALMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=coalman
COALMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a coalman
COALMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The central lands have an interesting geological feature: the rock is pock-marked with coal.  Easy access to this fuel has ensured that many of the more affluent households in the empire burn coal instead of wood, with the general lack of smoke being seen as a particularly nice feature.  Coalmen supply these households with the necessary fuel, mining it from known sources in the nearby dungeons and sewers.  This is often a dangerous job - the best coal is often found a thousand feet or more under the earth, and at that depth, the sorts of creatures found nearby can be very grim indeed.
COALMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The coalman's sooty face breaks into a gleaming white grin.
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Seams the Praetor Needs More Coal
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring ten pounds of coal to the coalman in the Praetor's house.
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_START_SID=The coalman looks frazzled.  "The praetor likes a warm house, and there's not nearly enough coal!  I can't supply him fast enough!"
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_START2_SID="I'll need at least ten pounds.  If you dig through the rock underground, you should find some soon enough.  Take my pick axe!"
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Keep digging through the rock and I'm sure you'll find some coal eventually!"
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The coalman looks relieved.  "Thank you so much.  Here, take these magici shards.  I find them when mining, but they're no use to me."
COALMAN_COAL_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Here's the key to the pantry, too - the scullerymaid was hoping to talk to you."
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor's scullerymaid
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_DESCRIPTION_SID=the Praetor's scullerymaid
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The scullerymaid is the lowest position in the noble household, staffed most often by young girls.  It pays little, the hours are long, and the work is menial: scrubbing pots and pans, assisting the cook with various tasks, and generally doing most of the work around the kitchen that the other help don't want to do themselves.  But though the work is hard, room and board is always provided, and the scullerymaid has the advantage of always being able to depend on three meals and shelter.
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The scullerymaid looks particularly haggard.
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Brandy's Dandy
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find some elven brandy for the scullerymaid in the Praetor's house.
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_START_SID=The scullerymaid's face turns white.  "The Praetor likes to have a bit of elven brandy alongside his coffee every morning."
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_START2_SID="But I've been so clumsy, and I knocked over his decanter!  Please help!  I'm sure you could find some somewhere."
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="I need a decanter of elven brandy."
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The scullerymaid relaxes.  "Thank you so much.  This will do very nicely.  Please take this silver apple!  It's fresh!"
PRAETOR_SCULLERYMAID_BOOZE_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="And here's the key to the kitchen - the cook's yelling for something."
PRAETOR_COOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor's cook
PRAETOR_COOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=the Praetor's cook
PRAETOR_COOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An important position in any noble's household is that of the cook.  For actually cooking one's own meals is the sort of thing the filthy peasants do: no, a well-bred noble will have someone to cook their food for them, freeing their time for important tasks like running down foxes on horseback and watching the dogs tear them apart (ho ho ho!), drinking powdered dragon teeth as a purported penile enhancer, or on rainy days, simply oppressing the plebs.  It falls on the cook to make the daily meals for an often considerable household, and that so many do so without outright poisoning their employers must be considered one of the ongoing mysteries of the world.
PRAETOR_COOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cook waves around a giant wooden spoon.
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Cook's Kale
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring two tomatoes, carrots, cabbages, potatoes, turnips, and bunches of spinach to the Praetor's cook.
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_START_SID=The cook starts to sweat.  "I've started a beef stew for the Praetor, but don't have enough vegetables to round it out!"
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_START2_SID="Perhaps we could help each other out.  Bring me two of each vegetable, and I'm sure I can find you something useful."
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Two of each vegetable for the stew!" the cook exclaims.
PRAETOR_COOK_FOOD_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The cook says, "Whew, thank you!  That'll do for the stew!  Here's a key to the door and a potion for you."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor's secretary
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_DESCRIPTION_SID=the Praetor's secretary
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Praetor Dantus is a busy man, and one who has accomplished a great deal.  While the largest share of the accolades must fall to the man himself, his private secretary works skillfully to ensure a balance between his public and private life.  Unlike most of the rest of the household, who are drawn from trustworthy members of the common classes, the Praetor's secretary is always a noble as well.  The eldest son of one of Carcassia's oldest families, the secretary received an excellent education in literature, the sciences, and military tradecraft.  This is typically a term position: after serving for a number of years, the secretary leaves his position to make his way in the world, carrying with him something very valuable - a letter of recommendation from the Praetor himself.
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Praetor's secretary scarcely looks up from his work.
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Ink and Quill
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring the Praetor's secretary a half-dozen quills and three inkpots.
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_START_SID=The Praetor's secretary looks up.  "The Praetor's correspondence is considerable.  I've used a ream of paper in the last fortnight alone."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_START2_SID="My supplies of ink and quills are running perilously low.  And I can't fetch these myself - I have letters to write."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_START3_SID="Fetch me a half-dozen quills and three inkpots.  That should do for now.  I'll make sure you're compensated."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Three inkpots and a half dozen quills, please."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The Praetor's secretary nods.  "Excellent, thank you.  Here's a pouch of ivory - I trust it will be enough."
PRAETOR_SECRETARY_WRITING_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="I should also let you know that the Praetor Dantus wishes to see you.  Here is the key to his study."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor Dantus
PRAETOR_DANTUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Praetor Dantus
PRAETOR_DANTUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The younger of two brothers, Dantus watched his brother become emperor, and with the birth of his nephew, knew that the throne could never be his.  Unlike many siblings in the history of Carcassia, who plotted intrigues to try to take the throne, Dantus became well-liked as an ardent supporter of his brother, and then his nephew.  In the absence of total power, he made do in other ways: acting as a general in the Carcassian army, writing treatises on philosophy and biology, and using his position to act as an important benefactor in the arts.  Now well into his sixties, Dantus walks with a noticeable stoop, but his tall stature, quick mind, and piercing stare ensure that he continues to command a great deal of respect well into the second decade of his nephew's reign.
PRAETOR_DANTUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Praetor Dantus greets you wearily.
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Seeking the Ironsword
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find the imperial sword Ironsword, last seen in the far southern lands, and bring it to Emperor Titus.
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_START_SID=Dantus looks you over.  "You seem to have had a few travels.  Perhaps we can help each other.  My name is Dantus, uncle to the Emperor."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_START2_SID="Last month a drunk old sailor staggered into the Floundering Catfish, and claimed to have seen a rough iron sword, glowing with its own light."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_START3_SID="He claimed he saw it in a ruined keep far to the south, at the edge of the world, guarded by many strange and wondrous birds."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_START4_SID="It is little to go on.  But it is intriguing.  Ironsword is a symbol of the Kell Empire, which the Emperor wishes to tie to his own."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_START5_SID="It would make a fine gift for the Emperor.  Find it, and bring it to him."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="An old sailor swears he once glimpsed the sword in a ruined keep far south of here. Find it, and bring it to the Emperor."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Praetor Dantus looks impressed.  "And who says the small folk can't accomplish great things?  Well done, adventurer - well done indeed."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="I expect this will be but a footnote in your great history.  Here, take these.  I hope that you find them useful."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="For as I'm sure you've noticed, the world is becoming uglier, filled with monsters who after dark stalk hill and heath."
PRAETOR_DANTUS_IRONSWORD_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID="There are whispers that the source is a rocky island far to the north west.  But now we now must part - thank you, and safe travels."
EMPEROR_TITUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Emperor Titus
EMPEROR_TITUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Emperor Titus
EMPEROR_TITUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The current emperor of Carcassia was crowned Titus when he was fifteen, his previous name erased from history.  His father having suffered from a long, wasting illness, the boy was groomed for years to take over the role.  Leaning on his uncle, the Praetor Dantus, the boy had some quick learning to do.  In his first few years, he put down a number of armed uprisings, and also directed the empire's resources against not just raiding parties of goblins and ogres, but the strange and increasing threat of monsters.  Public opinion is sharply divided on the man who now, in his late twenties, is coming into his own: some see a man with the barely suppressed instincts of a tyrant, while others see a ruthlessly efficient leader, a man who acts quickly and decisively in what he deems the best interests of the empire.
EMPEROR_TITUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Emperor Titus looks past you without even acknowledging your presence.
EMPEROR_TITUS_SPEECH_TEXT_ACK_SID=Emperor Titus tilts his head ever so slightly in acknowledgement.
EMPEROR_TITUS_IRONSWORD_SID=The Emperor nods.  "Ironsword was one of the greatswords of the empire, lost for almost two millennia.  Where on earth did you find it?"
EMPEROR_TITUS_IRONSWORD2_SID="The far southern reaches?  No, that will not do.  Those are barbarian lands, where pelted men live outside the law and divine."
EMPEROR_TITUS_IRONSWORD3_SID="Scribes!  Prepare a dispatch: Ironsword, symbol of the Emperor, has been found shining like a beacon in the shallow eastern seas."
EMPEROR_TITUS_IRONSWORD4_SID="Here is how it works, adventurer: all that matters is my truth and grace.  Do not think me ungrateful.  Take this - it is special to me."
EMPERORS_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Emperor's guard
EMPERORS_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=the Emperor's guard
EMPERORS_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Early in the Carcassian empire, the Emperor Iulus was viciously attacked by a peasant who had come to beg for judgement in a civil case.  The Emperor managed to protect himself until help arrived, but he never made the mistake of being without protection again, and formed the Emperor's Guard, an elite group of bodyguards selected from the finest (and most ruthless) members of the Carcassian guard.  Not just used as protection, the Guard have, it is said, also served as assassins and death squads, carrying out the orders of the Emperor, all orders, no matter how distasteful they may be.
EMPERORS_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Emperor's guard stands motionless, inscrutable behind a heavy, visored helm.
QUESTARE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Questare
QUESTARE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Questare
QUESTARE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The third son of a minor nobleman, Questare spent most of his childhood excruciatingly bored.  Much to the sadness of his designated whipping boy, Questare skipped out on lessons to go exploring, venturing into the Carcassian sewers and the island's sprawling fields.  This carefree life ended extremely abruptly, when while exploring a dungeon, he was waylaid by goblins, robbed, and his sword-hand removed by means of a thin, sharp stone.  After this, he wisely retired.  But gradually the boredom returned.  Now he uses his accumulated wealth to live vicariously through others, trading treasure and trinkets in exchange for quests he gives to feel that life again.
QUESTARE_SPEECH_LATER_SID=Questare says, "Come back a little later!"
QUESTARE_QUEST_TITLE_BASE_SID=Questare's Bidding (L%s)
QUESTARE_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Slay %s and return to Questare in the Emperor's fortress.
QUESTARE_QUEST_START_SID=Questare says, "So you want to prove your worth?  Well then, you've come to the right place!"
QUESTARE_QUEST_NEMESIS_SID="My arch-nemesis, %s, has been heard uttering threats against my family!  Eliminate the threat and report back to me."
QUESTARE_QUEST_NEMESIS2_SID="Recently, %s has been spotted rampaging through the dungeons!  Eliminate the threat and report back to me."
QUESTARE_QUEST_NEMESIS3_SID="I've witnessed %s publicly impugning my honour!  Eliminate the threat and report back to me."
QUESTARE_QUEST_NEMESIS4_SID="The small folk say %s has been stealing cats and small children!  Eliminate the threat and report back to me."
QUESTARE_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Slay %s and I'll see you're well rewarded."
QUESTARE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Questare smiles.  "Thank you!  You've done me a great service.  I trust you will find this useful."
SENATOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=senator
SENATOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a senator
SENATOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the Carcassian empire, the senate is a sham organization, the merest nod to what the empire used to be.  The city and surrounding lands used to be ruled by a senate of men and women who were representatives of their individual settlements.  They would gather to pass laws, judge over trials, and perform a number of other important roles.  But with the rise of the emperors, the senate has become little more than a symbol, offering legislative suggestions to the emperors, and serving as a placation for the plebians and a lie that the empire's past will forever be its present.
SENATOR_SPEECH_LATER_SID=The senator launches into a lengthy filibuster.
MAGICI_MERCHANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=magici merchant
MAGICI_MERCHANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a magici merchant
MAGICI_MERCHANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Gnomes claim that they were the first to fully understand the properties of magici - that it was not just a strange and brilliant stone, but contained within itself the essence of pure magic.  Though dwarves have also long delved deep into the earth, their interest has always been in precious metals.  Gnomes, on the other hand, care deeply about magic, and are entraced by magici.  It should be no surprise, then, that so many sellers of the stuff are gnomes.  They travel from town to town, aware that the hedge wizards and witches have a need, one which they are happy to help fill, for a fee.
MAGICI_MERCHANT_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_SID=The magici merchant shakes her head.  "Come back when you have a little more money."
MAGICI_MERCHANT_OFFER_SID=The magici merchant says, "I've got a lovely shard of magici here.  Five hundred ivory, and it's yours."
MAGICI_MERCHANT_DECLINE_SID="Perhaps another time, then."
MAGICI_MERCHANT_ACCEPT_SID="Splendid!  Here you are."
MAGICI_MERCHANT_SPEECH_LATER_SID=The magici merchant grins.  "Have a nice day!"
HERBALIST_DESCRIPTION_SID=herbalist
HERBALIST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a herbalist
HERBALIST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living deep within the old forests of the world, wood elves learn from a young age what is safe to eat.  And to ward off hunger on long trips, there is nothing better than the strange herb known as silverweed.  A spotted, silver plant, its flowers hang off a long, tall stem, and the plant itself is rare indeed.  It can grow in sun or shade, but for reasons yet unknown, refuses to grow after being replanted, or as a cutting.  Because of this, it is only found in the wild, and dried silverweed petals and sprigs have become valued items of trade, particularly among adventurers trekking deep into dungeons, caverns, and sewers.
HERBALIST_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS_SID=The herbalist says, "You'll need fifty ivory to purchase silverweed from me."
HERBALIST_OFFER_SID=The herbalist says, "If you're tired of hunting around for food, may I suggest a sprig of silverweed?  Fifty ivory today!"
HERBALIST_DECLINE_SID=The herbalist smirks.  "You'll regret this when you're hungry!"
HERBALIST_ACCEPT_SID=The herbalist cuts a small sprig from a larger plant, and hands it to you.
HERBALIST_SPEECH_LATER_SID=The herbalist waves goodbye.
SCAMANDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Scamander
SCAMANDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Scamander
SCAMANDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the captains of the Carcassian guards, Scamander is respected by the Emperor for his undying loyalty, and by the citizens of Carcassia for his surprising warmth and mercy.  One midwinter, during a public humiliation, a bread thief was pelted by rotten fruit and eggs when someone threw a rock.  Scamander had the man hauled off in chains, and released the thief from the stockade, seeing to his wounds and giving the man his own expensive, fur-lined cloak.  The scene made an impression on people, and it did not go unnoticed that under his watch there was a marked decrease in crime; this was not out of any kind of fear, but respect for the man and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law.
SCAMANDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Scamander nods a laconic greeting.
SCAMANDER_QUEST_TITLE_SID=A Unique Challenge
SCAMANDER_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kill three uniques for Scamander, captain of the Carcassian Guard.
SCAMANDER_QUEST_START_SID=Scamander looks you over.  He seems decidedly unimpressed.  "You seem pretty ill-equipped for the challenges ahead.  And that smell!"
SCAMANDER_QUEST_START2_SID="Never mind.  Perhaps I can put you to work.  I've been hassled by a number of named knaves - Grubb, Shale, the list goes on."
SCAMANDER_QUEST_START3_SID="Eliminate a few of them and I'll let you pick around my armory.  Perhaps I'll even throw in a few ivory for a hot bath..."
SCAMANDER_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Three uniques, adventurer!  Though I'd hardly complain if you dealt with more."
SCAMANDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Scamander says, "Three uniques killed - well done!  I'm a man of my word, so here's the key to the armory."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carcassian recruiter
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a Carcassian recruiter
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Carcassian army consists of three branches: the conventional army, a core group of professional soldiers; Heaven's Legion, the most powerful fighters in the empire; and the irregulars, a group of who-the-hell-knows paid by the task to deal with things that the rest of the army deems beneath it.  This can include a range of tasks, from putting down small insurrections, to patrolling unimportant parts of the frontier, to collecting taxes in dangerous areas.  Recruiters look for certain types of people for each branch of the army.  The conventionals are made up of minor nobles and wealthy commoners, Heaven's Legion of the most skilled and terrifying fighters, and for the irregulars, recruiters typically look for the ability to hold a spear, and the existence of a pulse.
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Carcassian recruiter says, "Sorry, there's nothing for the irregulars at the moment."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Grave Concerns
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Find and eliminate Garros, last seen on a small island at the south-eastern corner of the world.
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Garros was reported to have taken a number of ships to a small island at the south-eastern tip of the world."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The Carcassian recruiter nods.  "That does it, then.  You're now an irregular.  Sign here for your pay..."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=He pulls out some old equipment.  "This looks like it might fit.  Sorry about the smell.  The last owner didn't do so well."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_START_SID=The recruiter sizes you up.  "Yes...you might do.  I'm recruiting for the irregulars, and you seem capable enough."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_START2_SID="Garros, a graverobber and murderer, evaded capture a year back and I've heard he's hopped from ship to ship, slipping further away."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_GARROS_QUEST_START3_SID="He was last sighted in the far south-eastern corner of the world.  Eliminate him and you'll be a full member of the irregular forces."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Ogre Camp
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Destroy the leader of the ogre camp, Urgrim, whose camp is at the farthest south-western reaches.
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Destroy Urgrim!  His camp is far to the south-west, at the very edge of the world."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The recruiter seems impressed.  "Slaying an ogre chief is no mean feat.  You'll need a reward commensurate with that."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=He rummages around.  "Here you are.  A bit battered, but still good.  You'll be the envy of all the other mouthbreathers in your cohort."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_START_SID=The recruiter grins.  "Got a taste for military life, have you?  Well, good.  Because something's come up, and the last group didn't return."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_START2_SID="We've been harassd a lot by raiding parties, and I've heard that there's an ogre camp forming outside the formal boundaries of the empire."
CARCASSIAN_RECRUITER_CAMP_QUEST_START3_SID="They're far, far to the south-west - but make no mistake, they'll want to sail here eventually.  Find their camp, and eliminate their leader!"
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pitmistress Ghara
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pitmistress Ghara
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It seems both plausible and impossible that this young girl should be pitmistress of the feared Carcassian arena.  A girl of barely fifteen, slight and slender, she would at first seem an unlikely fighter.  But her left eye is gone, in its place a replacement made of smoky glass; her left arm is horrifically burned, her hand blackened and shrivelled; and looped into her belt is a long chain sickle, and eleven tiny knives.  She is renowned in the empire as the only woman to survive twenty five fights, and it's said that the Emperor Titus, impressed by her cold, efficient victories, granted her freedom and a small estate on the edge of the city.  In return, she now serves as pitmistress, arranging the spectacles of gladiators and beasts, enjoying the rest of her life even as she ends so many others.
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_FIGHT_QUERY_SID=Pitmistress Ghara seems to stare right through you.  "So.  You would test yourself in the fighting pits?"
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_FIGHT_ACCEPT_SID=A voice carries over the edge of the fighting pits: "Give us spectacle!"
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_FIGHT_DECLINE_SID=Pitmistress Ghara looks at you with barely disguised contempt.
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Pitmistress Ghara nods appreciatively.  "The arena has nothing left to teach you."
PITMISTRESS_GHARA_QUEST_TITLE_SID=The Fighting Pits (%s)

CORBETT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Corbett
CORBETT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Corbett
CORBETT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Emperor's huntmaster, Corbett spends much of his time in the remote wilds of Carcassia, looking for game fit for the head of an empire.  A small man, Corbett stands barely over five feet tall; the throwing spears he brings for hunting stand nearly as tall as him.  Usually working with a number of other hunters, Corbett leads expeditions to bring back game for the table of the Emperor and his closest circle, as well as, when possible, fantastic creatures for the emperor to display or mount within his fortress' walls.
CORBETT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Corbett says, "Preparations are complete - I'll be heading out soon."

CORBETT_TEACH_HUNTING_DECLINE_SID="Come back if you change your mind."
COMMONER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=commoner
COMMONER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a commoner
COMMONER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Commoners occupy a precarious place in society - not born into the easy wealth and conjured prestige of the nobility, they nonetheless at least find themselves above the slaves and stateless refugees who eke out the barest life on toil and the hoped-for goodwill of others.  Commoners range from the flower-sellers who earn a meagre living and starve through winter, to the fur and textile merchants who arrange shipments from far off lands and enjoy comfortable evenings of lesiure.  But each commoner has something in common: they will never been seen as an equal by the nobility, no matter how wealthy they become, and they rely on a set of laws and strictures written by others and beyond any hope of control.
COMMONER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The commoner flashes a disgusting smile.
SMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=smith
SMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a smith
SMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Smiths play an important role in the community.  Aside from the creation of weapons such as swords and axe-heads and spear-points, smiths manufacture all kinds of day to day items, such as nails and horseshoes.  Smiths typically work with iron or bronze of varying quality; weak alloys or use of bog iron is fairly common, and sometimes unavoidable depending on what deposits are nearby.  And it is difficult work, requiring a great deal of strength, endurance, and attention to shape items well, maintain the necessary temperatures in the forge, and see to the constant stream of orders from the community.
SMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The smith looks up from the bellows.
WEAVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=weaver
WEAVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a weaver
WEAVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Weavers keep their villages clothed.  Working with wool or natural plant fibres, they use a spinning wheel to create threads and yarns, then use a loom to turn it into lengths of cloth, blankets, and other items.  The production of these things is important for trade: fortunes have been made selling bolts of fine cloth and silk to nobles of the royal houses, though it should be pointed out that it is never the weaver who becomes rich this way.
WEAVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The weaver ignores you, focusing on a pattern in the loom.
JEWELER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=jeweler
JEWELER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a jeweler
JEWELER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While smiths work with iron, steel, and bronze, jewelers work with precious metals such as silver and gold to create beautiful jewelry.  Melting these metals, and using molds, jewelers can create rings and tiny necklace links, then combine these with precious and semi-precious stones to create magnificent pieces of jewelry.  Magic, it's said, loves gold: wizards throughout the ages have noticed that a simple ring can contain as much magic as a greatsword, and is much easier to carry around.  Because of this, jewelers are treated well by those who practice magic, and wizards will often trade magical favours in exchange for rings and torques for use in enchantment.
JEWELER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The jeweler greets you.
SCRIBE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=scribe
SCRIBE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a scribe
SCRIBE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=More precious than gold is the ability to write.  A language is only alive so long as it's spoken; but if it's written down, it can last far beyond the people who spoke it.  Scribes are central to this preservation, writing down legends, poems, and myths, but also more mundane things such as records of debt, shipping lists, even recipes.  Indeed, through the accident of survival, all that is known of one particular culture is a recipe for rosemary pan bread, which is perhaps a strange way to be remembered, but everyone agrees that the recipe really is quite good.
SCRIBE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The scribe looks up, startled by your presence.
NOBLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=noble
NOBLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a noble
NOBLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Born into positions of wealth and prestige, nobles perpetuate the lie that birth is destiny, and some accident of fate necessarily make them better.  Afforded a life of ease and luxury, nobles are happier and live longer than those they consider beneath them.  But nobility and the political system built around it teeters delicately, built on rules and control, and through uprising there is freedom - more than one line of kings has ended up swinging from a tree, their bodies cut down to fatten the pigs for fall.
NOBLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The noble ignores your greeting.

DIRT_SID=handful of dirt
DIRT_USAGE_SID=a handful of dirt
DIRT_CODEX_SID=Literally dirt.
SHOVEL_SID=shovel
SHOVEL_USAGE_SID=a shovel
SHOVEL_CODEX_SID=Although not hard enough to dig into rock, shovels are perfectly designed for digging into earth.  The more practical applications would be things like gardening, or getting rid of bodies, but given the age of the world, and all the empires that have come and gone, it's believed that there's a staggering amount of things hiding beneath the earth, both worthless and priceless, and by rights, it goes to those who find it first.
TALMAI_BODY_SID=body of Talmai
TALMAI_BODY_USAGE_SID=the body of Talmai
TALMAI_BODY_CODEX_SID=The Carcassian empire of the centre lands currently wields a massive amount of influence, having no opponents of similar size.  As such, its citizens feel a certain invincibility when travelling abroad.  But the world is a very dangerous place, as Talmai found out when sent as a religious emissary to the snake lands.  The snakelings killed and beheaded him, cutting out his tongue, and sending it back with a cobra writhing angrily in its place.
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_SID=mummified corpse
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_USAGE_SID=a mummified corpse
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_CODEX_SID=Several cultures practice mummification of the dead, and this practice exists in multiple forms.  Dry mummification is practiced by some desert peoples, who leave the bodies of the dead deep within the sand dunes, where the intense heat and dryness quickly removes the moisture from the corpse.  In wetter areas with large peat bogs, the acidic water conditions preserve the body startlingly well, and other cultures remove the body's fluids at death, keeping it in conditions carefully controlled for humidity, using embalming fluid to preserve the corpse for years to come.
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_1_SID=mummified corpse of a fallen hero
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_1_USAGE_SID=a mummified corpse of a fallen hero
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_2_SID=mummified corpse of an elven champion
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_2_USAGE_SID=a mummified corpse of an elven champion
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_3_SID=mummified corpse of a dwarven warrior-king
MUMMIFIED_CORPSE_AMAUR_3_USAGE_SID=a mummified corpse of a dwarven warrior-king
PILE_OF_BONES_SID=pile of bones
PILE_OF_BONES_USAGE_SID=a pile of bones
PILE_OF_BONES_CODEX_SID=A pile of bones, indeterminate origin, persons unknown, and count uncertain but multiple, containing several skulls, femurs, scapulae, pelves; an above-ground grave, an open ossuary, an ending whispered by the open air.
HANDFUL_GLEAMING_WYRM_SCALES_SID=handful of gleaming wyrm scales
HANDFUL_GLEAMING_WYRM_SCALES_USAGE_SID=a handful of gleaming wyrm scales
HANDFUL_GLEAMING_WYRM_SCALES_CODEX_SID=Dragon- and wyrm-scale have long been famed for their protective properties.  Eventually, though, the untreated hide to which its attached will rot away, leaving loose scales behind.  At this point, they became purely decorative, shattering under heavy force, and losing their ability to soak heat.  But even in this state, they fetch a hefty price.  Scattered about the mansion as an, "oh what, this wyrmscale?", or used in quilting or other crafts, a mere handful of these are worth their weight in ivory.  These can sometimes be found in remote beaches, the tides carrying the bodies out to sea, and after decomposition, scattering the remains; a whole cottage industry of beachcombers exists to collect and sell the scales.
BOG_IRON_SID=lump of bog iron
BOG_IRON_USAGE_SID=a lump of bog iron
BOG_IRON_CODEX_SID=Bog iron is an impure form of iron found in the surface waters of swamps and marshes.  When iron-bearing water reaches the surface, the dissolved iron can be oxidized by various processes; it sits below the surface, at ground level or possibly below, where it can be extracted and used for forging.  The quality of the iron is typically not as good as that extracted by traditional iron mines, but bog iron has the advantage of being easy to extract, and the sites themselves are easy to spot, either the result of mountain streams flowing down into marshlands, or swamps whose water is pushed up through cracks in the rocks below.
IRON_INGOT_SID=iron ingot
IRON_INGOT_USAGE_SID=an iron ingot
IRON_INGOT_CODEX_SID=Though gold and silver get all the glory, iron is in many senses far more valuable.  Having a high tensile strength, it's suitable for building many things, from sword-blades to portcullises.  It's easy to extract from the ground, and occurs almost uniformly throughout the world.  There is even a naturally-occurring above-ground form, bog iron, that can form naturally in swamps and marshes, less pure, but simple to harvest.  Because of this, most cultures make heavy use of iron, or at least supplement their use of bronze.
STEEL_INGOT_SID=steel ingot
STEEL_INGOT_USAGE_SID=a steel ingot
STEEL_INGOT_CODEX_SID=A mixture of iron and carbon, steel can have a number of properties according to the alloy created.  A popular variety is stainless steel, which resists rusting, and this is particularly favoured for use in building.  Far beyond the means of most, steel is used by kings and emperors to create great fortresses.  A number of past empires have preferred steel-and-concrete to stone-and-mortar, given the enormous strength of steel, and the ability to shape it into different forms.  But the ability to make such massive pieces requires facilities that appear to be lost to the world.  So many great empires have come and gone, and so too has passed, at least for now, the great age of steel.
LUMP_GOLD_SID=small lump of gold
LUMP_GOLD_USAGE_SID=a small lump of gold
LUMP_GOLD_CODEX_SID=Gold is pretty, and certainly valuable, but its deeply uneven distribution has meant that it is not accepted as currency throughout the world.  Instead, ivory is preferred, for in a world of islands, it has the benefits of being both rare and renewable.  Still, gold is fiercely coveted, especially by the dwarves.  Their great mines snake through the earth, a series of large, open rooms and narrow tunnels that branch periodically to form an underground network.  The dwarven people follow the gold veins deep into the earth, and its said that the great dwarven-kings of old kept massive vaults many times larger than a dragon's hoard, a rumour that has enticed an untold number of adventurers, though the vaults, as far as anyone can tell, remain rumours.
MAGICI_SHARD_SID=magici shard
MAGICI_SHARD_USAGE_SID=a magici shard
MAGICI_SHARD_CODEX_SID=In the early days of the universe, everything was magic.  At the moment of creation, religious texts say, the universe was created by Celeste, who formed the entire cosmos by her divine will.  As everything bore her touch, everything was, implicitly, magic.  But as the universe aged, these magics cooled, and things became more mundane and ordinary.  In all this, though, traces of that early universe remain.  Crystalized within the earth as shards of pure energy, magici is rare and coveted, used to give magical form to things.  It can be used to create wands, focus magics, and has other uses that only wizards know.  It can take a number of colours, but often appears a deep red in colour, warm to the touch, pulsing light to dark.
COAL_SID=piece of coal
COAL_USAGE_SID=a piece of coal
COAL_CODEX_SID=Coal is compressed carbon, the result of millions of years of pressure on plant matter covered, layer by layer, with other matter, forced underground and eventually forming a hard, rock-like material.  Occurring in large pockets and seams, discovered in great quantities in the central lands, it is cheap to mine, and a ready source of fuel.  Coal produces a great deal of heat for the volume involved, making it attractive compared to the deforestation required to sustain larger communities with wood stoves.  Coal is not without disadvantages: its smoke is particularly harmful, but for those looking to stay warm, these sorts of life-long issues get pushed aside in the winter.
SKIN_SID=%s skin
SKIN_USAGE_SID=%s skin
APPLE_SEED_SID=apple seed
APPLE_SEED_USAGE_SID=an apple seed
PAPER_PULP_SID=paper pulp
PAPER_PULP_USAGE_SID=paper pulp
PAPER_PULP_CODEX_SID=The final phase before the making of paper is the creation of paper pulp.  Normally, this is done in a pulp mill that takes lumber and other materials and breaks it down into raw pulp.  But in a pinch, anything made of paper can be made into pulp.  Old books, unwanted scrolls, these can all be made into brand new, blank paper, assuming a pulper is present to actually make the pulp, and there is a mold and deckle to carefully form and dry the wet pulp into new paper.
QUILL_SID=quill
QUILL_USAGE_SID=a quill
QUILL_CODEX_SID=Writing requires ink and an instrument, and that instrument is more often than not a quill.  Made from the hollowed feather of a bird, the tip is cut to hold ink when dipped into an inkwell.  A properly cut tip allows the interior of the feather to act as a resevoir, holding a small amount of ink, perhaps enough to write a single line.  Each quill requires infrequent cutting of the tip as part of its maintenance, and the plenitude of birds ensures that some kind of replacement is always nearby.
INKPOT_SID=inkpot
INKPOT_USAGE_SID=an inkpot
INKPOT_CODEX_SID=Writing requires ink and an instrument.  The instrument is typically a quill, but the ink is far more varied.  There are as many ways of making ink as there are scriptoria.  Common sources include the bark of hawthorne trees, oak galls, or the ink of cuttlefish or squid.  Once prepared, the precious ink is carefully sealed into small bottles, enough to write a long scroll or a short book.  But with the expansion of the Carcassian empire, and the organized worship of the Nine, there is a need for more texts: more psalms, more hymns, more holy books.  This has put a pinch on an already stretched ink supply, and the huddled monks are always looking for more.
CHERRY_PIT_SID=cherry pit
CHERRY_PIT_USAGE_SID=a cherry pit
PEACH_PIT_SID=peach pit
PEACH_PIT_USAGE_SID=a peach pit
PEAR_SEED_SID=pear seed
PEAR_SEED_USAGE_SID=a pear seed
PLUM_PIT_SID=plum pit
PLUM_PIT_USAGE_SID=a plum pit
OLIVE_PIT_SID=olive pit
OLIVE_PIT_USAGE_SID=an olive pit
GOLDEN_APPLE_SEED_SID=golden apple seed
GOLDEN_APPLE_SEED_USAGE_SID=a golden apple seed
SILVER_APPLE_SEED_SID=silver apple seed
SILVER_APPLE_SEED_USAGE_SID=a silver apple seed
WAVE_LOCKET_SID=locket engraved with waves
WAVE_LOCKET_USAGE_SID=a locket engraved with waves
WAVE_LOCKET_CODEX_SID=A small, gold locket, its two covers engraved with a steep, stylized breaker.  Inside, the covers are engraved with "Ca" and "Co", and contain a tiny ouroboros of light blonde hair.
FALCONS_EYE_SID=ruby ring "Falcon's Eye"
FALCONS_EYE_USAGE_SID=the ruby ring "Falcon's Eye"
FALCONS_EYE_CODEX_SID=A white gold ring set with a brilliant topaz, Falcon's Eye was a symbol of the Kell Empire.  The exact white gold alloy used was said to be reserved for the emperors themselves; and commissioned by the emperor, the ring was received on the eve of the anniversary of the empire.  Falcon's Eye glows with an unstable, internal light.  Worn by the champions of the Kell army, it's said that the ring turns aside both blades and magic, announcing its presence in combat by its radiant, yellow aura.
CARPATHOS_SID=jasper ring "Carpathos"
CARPATHOS_USAGE_SID=the jasper ring "Carpathos"
CARPATHOS_CODEX_SID=The ring Carpathos looks like a twisted piece of jade, carved perfectly into its current form.  But the truth is far from that.  Thousands of years ago, the sorceror Carpathos, tired of the upper world, decided to map a massive network of caverns near his home.  Arriving at a massive chamber, he found a huge green fierce snake barring the way.  With a word, the wizard grasped the snake, and held it immobilized.  He slowly shrank it, twisting the serpent down to the size of a ring, and until his death, wearing the creature's essence on his finger.
ASTURIAS_SID=tiger's eye ring "Asturias"
ASTURIAS_USAGE_SID=the tiger's eye ring "Asturias"
ASTURIAS_CODEX_SID=The Ybari people of the south-west occupy a small, ideally situated island.  A mountainous place, the island Ybara is full of steep ascents and narrow pathways, a defender's paradise, allowing them to safely resist the imperial designs of the Carcassian Empire, which they have had to do twice.  For their island is valuable, its mountains containing great deposits of silver and stones.  This is where the ring Asturias came from.  Recently, the Carcassians had sent a considerable force to Ybara, cloaking their ships in magic.  But this magic came undone when they grounded unexpectedly against some rocks, and the Ybari beach sentry, who was wearing the ring, sprinted to the top of the mountains effortlessly to warn of the attack.  The Ybari slew every soldier sent, then sank the Carcassian ships in the shallow harbour, leaving nothing but their masts flying the imperial flag.
ARAN_FEE_SID=Ring of Aran Fee
ARAN_FEE_USAGE_SID=the Ring of Aran Fee
ARAN_FEE_CODEX_SID=Since the destruction of the great continent that covered the world, the islands it formed have drifted.  Through the millennia, these have largely become charted, and so the basic structure of the upper world is known.  But less known is the ocean itself, and the great explorer Aran Fee took it upon herself to chart these as best she could.  Cloaked in layer upon layer of seal-skin, and protected by a ring that let her breathe water, she descended into the northern oceans.  But on her return she was changed, raving about an undersea prison, a creature from the stars, and how he promised her that one day it would rise again.
FENCERS_RING_SID=fencer's ring
UNID_FENCERS_RING_SID=sapphire ring
FENCERS_RING_USAGE_SID=a fencer's ring
UNID_FENCERS_RING_USAGE_SID=a sapphire ring
FENCERS_RING_CODEX_SID=At some point in the past, one of the great sabre-fighters developed a technique whereby he fought one-handed, but in his off-hand, wore a heavy, decorated ring.  This ring had a cross on it that, when held in front of him, allowed him to more effectively aim at his opponents.  That was the story, anyway; but he lived to die of old age, something most swordsmen never get.  Most fencers have found that they fight just as well without the ring as with it, but the myth persists, and to this day many fencers still wear something similar.
WITHERING_RING_SID=withering ring
UNID_WITHERING_RING_SID=aquamarine ring
WITHERING_RING_USAGE_SID=a withering ring
UNID_WITHERING_RING_USAGE_SID=an aquamarine ring
WITHERING_RING_CODEX_SID=Perhaps scattered throughout the world's treasure-hoards by the Trickster, withering rings teach the unwary not to blindly try on everything they see.  The ring's touch is cold, and it fuses to the skin by means of some foul curse.  Sapping the ring-bearer's energy and body mass, withering rings cause the wearer to shrink and shrivel.  Unable to muster much energy, their reflexes dull, and they become far less able to dodge incoming strikes.  Because of this, it has become bad luck among adventurers to wear the rings taken from a dead man's hand.
STUMBLING_RING_SID=stumbling ring
UNID_STUMBLING_RING_SID=cobalt ring
STUMBLING_RING_USAGE_SID=a stumbling ring
UNID_STUMBLING_RING_USAGE_SID=a cobalt ring
STUMBLING_RING_CODEX_SID=Fusing to the skin once worn, stumbling rings are designed to look like a number of other rings.  But their presence is announced immediately - they send jolts up and down the legs, causing feet to fall asleep and the victim to stumble awkwardly.  These fits always seem to happen at the worst possible time: when ambushed by goblins, for example, or approaching the mouth of a gaping pit.
BARBARIANS_RING_SID=barbarian's ring
UNID_BARBARIANS_RING_SID=serendibite ring
BARBARIANS_RING_USAGE_SID=a barbarian's ring
UNID_BARBARIANS_RING_USAGE_SID=a serendibite ring
BARBARIANS_RING_CODEX_SID=The pale and dark-haired warriors of a particular southern tribe charge into combat completely naked.  Spending the hours before battle fortifying themselves with alcohol, or getting high on psychotropic plants, they then grab their spears and axes and greatswords and fight until victory, exhaustion, or death.  For reasons they've never felt compelled to explain, these warriors wear iron rings into combat, though, it must be said, not on their fingers.
GUILDMASTERS_RING_SID=guildmaster's ring
UNID_GUILDMASTERS_RING_SID=malachite ring
GUILDMASTERS_RING_USAGE_SID=a guildmaster's ring
UNID_GUILDMASTERS_RING_USAGE_SID=a malachite ring
GUILDMASTERS_RING_CODEX_SID=Guildmasters characteristically wear a gold band topped with three small gems as a sign of their rank and office.  The type of gem varies - thieves prefer diamonds, smiths rubies, artisans sapphires - but the style of the ring and the cut of the gemstones has been largely standardized for hundreds of years.  Nobody really knows where the practice came from, though many people suspect it was simply a way of identifying the exclusivity of one's rank, in the way that it's taboo for anyone but a wizard to wear a robe of a certain grey, or purple in the presence of a king.
KNIGHTS_RING_SID=knight's ring
UNID_KNIGHTS_RING_SID=turquoise ring
KNIGHTS_RING_USAGE_SID=a knight's ring
UNID_KNIGHTS_RING_USAGE_SID=a turquoise ring
KNIGHTS_RING_CODEX_SID=The "knight's ring" is a poetic term for an armoured, fingerless glove.  A leather glove covered by a large, steel plate, it contains as well a curved bit of metal - the "catcher" - on top.  Knight's rings protect the hand as ably as a shield, though offering a much smaller surface.  But those who fight with it learn to use it effectively.  When combined with good reflexes, the catcher can be used to hold a blade - and with a flick of the wrist, disarm the attacker as well.
RING_IRON_SID=ring of iron
UNID_RING_IRON_SID=tourmaline ring
RING_IRON_USAGE_SID=a ring of iron
UNID_RING_IRON_USAGE_SID=a tourmaline ring
RING_IRON_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  When iron becomes laced with magici, it takes on strange, absorptive properties, trapping some of the physical force when struck and harmlessly releasing it.  Very little of this material is available - magici is rare enough in its pure form, and rarer still when bled - and so the thin scraps available are often fashioned into rings.
RING_FLAME_SID=ring of flames
UNID_RING_FLAME_SID=peridot ring
RING_FLAME_USAGE_SID=a ring of flames
UNID_RING_FLAME_USAGE_SID=a peridot ring
RING_FLAME_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Rings of fire are created by exposing the ring to great heat very briefly, before sealing the ring with a ward.  Many wizards create these by working with a smith, using the great heat of their forges to lock in the essence of flame.  More powerful still would be the breath of a dragon, though this has yet to be tried, as dragons are rarely cooperative.
RING_ICE_SID=ring of ice
UNID_RING_ICE_SID=alexandrite ring
RING_ICE_USAGE_SID=a ring of ice
UNID_RING_ICE_USAGE_SID=an alexandrite ring
RING_ICE_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Rings of ice are tricky to create, if only for the fact that much of the world's population lives in the central lands, where winters are rainy, not snowy, and great icebergs loosed from the far north and south only rarely pass.  But the essence of these - holding up the blank ring in a snowstorm, or against the side of a drifting iceberg - can be sealed into an empty ring, and be lifesaving when the weather suddenly turns.
RING_ACID_SID=ring of acid
UNID_RING_ACID_SID=emerald ring
RING_ACID_USAGE_SID=a ring of acid
UNID_RING_ACID_USAGE_SID=an emerald ring
RING_ACID_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  To make rings of acid, the ring must be imprinted with acids before being magically sealed.  This can prove quite difficult, not just because of the corrosive properties of strong acids, but because of the difficulty in retrieving the ring afterwards.  Accordingly, many lesser examples are made with everyday acids, such as the acetic acid found in vinegar, or the citric acids found in oranges, lemons, and limes.
RING_POISON_SID=ring of poison
UNID_RING_POISON_SID=jade ring
RING_POISON_USAGE_SID=a ring of poison
UNID_RING_POISON_USAGE_SID=a jade ring
RING_POISON_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Rings of poison are delicate things to make.  Typically made using the venom of tiny jungle-snakes, or strange underwater creatures, it has been observed that the poison only fuses with the magici while its source is still alive.  This requires capturing the creature and somehow milking its poison, a process which, for the most powerful venoms, can be very dangerous indeed.
RING_HOLINESS_SID=ring of holiness
UNID_RING_HOLINESS_SID=diamond ring
RING_HOLINESS_USAGE_SID=a ring of holiness
UNID_RING_HOLINESS_USAGE_SID=a diamond ring
RING_HOLINESS_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Rings of holiness are created through the interplay of arcane and divine magics.  The blank ring is brought to a priest or another religious leader, and is then blessed while at the same time being sealed by a wizard's magic.  The result is a small piece of the divine, a strangely ethereal thing which glows with a holy aura and feels light upon the finger.
RING_SHADOWS_SID=ring of shadows
UNID_RING_SHADOWS_SID=onyx ring
RING_SHADOWS_USAGE_SID=a ring of shadows
UNID_RING_SHADOWS_USAGE_SID=an onyx ring
RING_SHADOWS_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Historically, rings of shadows have been rarer than other elemental rings.  Witchlings almost always live their lives apart, forced by fear to live as hermits on the fringes of society, or deep within the wilderness.  But some have lived with wizards and shared their magics.  When cast upon rings, the final result has a inky but translucent sheen.  The rings pulse with primordial energy, sending small shocks periodically up the arm, and some wearers have reported hearing strange voices talking to them in distant, unknowable tongues.
RING_SORCERY_SID=ring of sorcery
UNID_RING_SORCERY_SID=opal ring
RING_SORCERY_USAGE_SID=a ring of sorcery
UNID_RING_SORCERY_USAGE_SID=an opal ring
RING_SORCERY_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Rings of sorcery contain the pure essence of arcane magic.  They are exhausting to make - the wizard finalizing the magics must simultaneously interweave both a steady source of arcane castings, as well as the final spell of binding.  This process is fiendishly difficult, and it has been observed that wizards either have a talent for this, or don't.  Some masters have confessed that they are unable to do the required mental and verbal separation, and the creation of this specific type of ring is intentionally left off the curriculum at the high tower.
RING_LIGHTNING_SID=ring of lightning
UNID_RING_LIGHTNING_SID=topaz ring
RING_LIGHTNING_USAGE_SID=a ring of lightning
UNID_RING_LIGHTNING_USAGE_SID=a topaz ring
RING_LIGHTNING_CODEX_SID=Magici is the essence of pure magic, and is typically found in crystals in the ground.  But sometimes, thin threads of it, bled magici, permeate other substances.  Inert until activated by magic, these rings are created by artisans, activated by wizards, and held close by adventurers.  Particularly favoured by adventurers, rings of lightning grant some degree of resistance to electricity, which while useful in general terms, is specifically valued for how it helps guard against paralysis, which in the depths of a dungeon is almost always a death sentence.  Capturing the essence of electricity is difficult.  Electric eels are the preferred method, but not always available.  A more makeshift method involves placing the ring on top of a very high pole during a thunderstorm, while at the same time casting spells to try to lure the lightning closer.
CAP_SID=cap
CAP_USAGE_SID=a cap
CAP_CODEX_SID=Most travellers will wear some sort of cap, usually one made of cloth, and often with a peaked brim.  This isn't much for protection, but rather to provide a bit of relief from the sun and rain.  Some of these caps are made to be a bit looser, with little pockets on the inside for coins and trinkets, religious charms, and other personal items.
HIDE_CAP_SID=%s-hide cap
HIDE_CAP_USAGE_SID=%s-hide cap
HIDE_CODEX_SID=Most leather items are made of cow-hide: cows are big (lots of leather), slow (easy to chase down), and oblivious (easy to kill).  Cow-leather makes for perfectly serviceable clothing, but has a prominent disadvantage, that being that it comes from the perfectly ordinary cow.  For leather, you see, takes on the character of the creature from which it came.  Dragon-hide is particular tough, almost like steel, while other creatures might provide resistance to heat or cold, magic or shadow.  Pity the lowly cow - it is resistant to nothing, and its leather is unremarkable, save for the fact that it covers the tasty cow-meat underneath.
THIEFS_CAP_SID=thief's cap
THIEFS_CAP_USAGE_SID=a thief's cap
THIEFS_CAP_CODEX_SID=The style of headwear popularized by so many ne'er-do-wells is not actually a cap, but the name has stuck.  A single piece of fabric, long and often earth-toned, the cap is actually a bandana, the ends of which form a small, tight knot.  Depending on the pattern, this can provide a measure of camouflage, particularly outdoors, but also has a more practical function.  Covering up the hair, it prevents a range of dirty tricks, such as grabbing someone by the hair to be able to pull them close and quickly slit their throat.
GUILDMASTERS_CAP_SID=guildmaster's cap
GUILDMASTERS_CAP_USAGE_SID=a guildmaster's cap
GUILDMASTERS_CAP_CODEX_SID=A popular style of cap worn by guildmasters everywhere is the tall, pointed cap, with its distinctive, turned up brim - feather optional, though typical.  Usually made of a heavy and sturdy cloth, it is treated so as to be waterproof, providing a measure of protection against the weather, while the colour and ornaments codify the guild to which the wearer belongs.
LEATHER_HELM_SID=leather helm
LEATHER_HELM_USAGE_SID=a leather helm
LEATHER_HELM_CODEX_SID=A cheap form of headwear, leather helms provide a bit of protection, absorbing glancing blows, and turning aside the weakest slashes.  Still, this is better than nothing: the problem with blood loss is that, left unstaunched, it leads to dizziness, then unconsciousness, and death.  Survival is all about increasing your chances, even just a little.  A sturdy helmet, even one made of leather, makes that just a little more likely.
METAL_CAP_SID=metal cap
METAL_CAP_USAGE_SID=a metal cap
METAL_CAP_CODEX_SID=Made from a lighter metal such as aluminum, the metal cap is not meant to withstand a barrage of powerful blows - it dents easily, and can be knocked off the defender's head by a clean strike.  But it does provide a good deal more absorbancy than plain leather, while being significantly lighter than the iron and steel helms worn by the heavy infantry.  Most importantly, for many, is the price - as it's made of significantly less metal, and one that is easy to work, it costs far less than most other metal armours.
IRON_HELM_SID=iron helm
IRON_HELM_USAGE_SID=an iron helm
IRON_HELM_CODEX_SID=A popular style of helmet with heavy infantry throughout history is the iron helm, which covers most of the head and nose, while leaving the rest of the face free to ensure the combatant has a good view of the combat around them.  In some cultures, these helmets were crested, either with horsehair bleached and dyed with brilliant colours, or with the feathers of magnificent birds such as peacocks, eagles, or most rare of all, the magnificent roc.
STEEL_HELM_SID=steel helm
STEEL_HELM_USAGE_SID=a steel helm
STEEL_HELM_CODEX_SID=Steel, being harden than iron, requires less metal to offer the same protection.  And given the difficulty in making consistent, high-grade steel, helmets made of steel are very valuable indeed, rare enough that a common solution is to attach thin steel plates to leather helmets, accomplishing a similar result while at the same time requiring significantly less steel.  As well, some steel alloys have been found to require significantly less care to prevent rust, and the collection of steel equipment after large-scale battles has become a standard practice by victorious generals.
KNIGHTS_HELM_SID=knight's helm
KNIGHTS_HELM_USAGE_SID=a knight's helm
KNIGHTS_HELM_CODEX_SID=Heavier than the iron and steel helmets worn by most warriors are the great helmets known by most as "knight's helms".  These cover the entire head, usually with a small visor and small holes, smaller than an arrowhead, to allow for breathing and the smallest degree of cooling.  Worn by heavily armoured knights, these helms are part of an ensemble of armour that provides an enormous amount of protection from conventional weaponry.  But while this sort of armour will easily turn aside a slash with a sword or axe, it does not offer invincibility, and death comes in the gaps: for the body armour, a long knife can be thrust through the joints, while for the helmets, the visor allows easy access for a dagger or a simple metal spike.
DRAGON_HELM_SID=dragon helm
DRAGON_HELM_USAGE_SID=a dragon helm
DRAGON_HELM_CODEX_SID=Many of the early legends and surviving poems seem to share a common theme: a hero thrust against a bestiary of impossible creatures, and wearing the most splendid and unimaginable armour.  The age of dragons has long since passed, but its stories tell of men and women who dressed to appear as if dragons themselves, wearing armour crafted from dragonscale.  Though the process of their creation is lost, the stories say that the helmets were made to appear exactly as a dragon's head, giving the wearer a terrifying appearance.  But beyond the fear that this would strike, it had a very practical purpose, offering additional protection against great heat, so that it's said that a hero wearing a full suit of dragon armour could be breathed on by a dragon, and somehow live to tell.
SCRIMSHAW_HAIRPIN_SID=scrimshaw hairpin
SCRIMSHAW_HAIRPIN_USAGE_SID=a scrimshaw hairpin
SCRIMSHAW_HAIRPIN_CODEX_SID=Scrimshaw art, the decoration of ivory or bone with carvings of various kinds, is popular among all the people of the world.  Cadlind, being an inveterate traveller, picked up the hobby early, and on a long trip through the southern reaches, spent the days nestled in the corner of a ship's hold, beneath a pile of wolf-skins, shivering from the uncommonly cold winter.  Taking a small bit of whale-bone, she first shaped it into a hairpin, and then using a discarded nail, began to cover it with a sea scene: two right whales, swimming side-by side, a tall ship sailing away far in the background.
CROWN_OF_TYRANNY_SID=Crown of Tyranny
CROWN_OF_TYRANNY_USAGE_SID=the Crown of Tyranny
CROWN_OF_TYRANNY_CODEX_SID=Thought to be a creation by a great smith during the Wolf Age, the Crown of Tyranny is an ugly creation of rough iron.  It lacks the gems and precious metals present on the rich crowns of kings and statesmen, for this is a battle-crown: around the rim, a series of long, dull spikes, give the wearer a fearsome appearance, and the whole thing smokes and hisses as it's worn.  The crown's provenance is uncertain.  Said to have been created by a northern and illiterate tribe during the days before the Kell Empire, it is attested to only in secondary sources, and at some point it was lost - buried, or thrown to the sea - and has not been seen for many thousands of years.
HELM_OF_THE_HEAVENS_SID=Helm of the Heavens
HELM_OF_THE_HEAVENS_USAGE_SID=the Helm of the Heavens
HELM_OF_THE_HEAVENS_CODEX_SID=In the days before he was to lead a massed army against the Dragon Lords and their human thralls, the elven king Garalin spent the nights deep in prayer to Celeste; and as he prayed, Celeste reached down to bless him with the grace of the divine.  She laid her hand upon his head, and as she did so gave him her knowledge and protection.  Celeste spoke to the elven-king wordlessly, showing him where the Dragon Lords would meet; and armed with this knowledge, the greatest of his sorcerors, in a final act of sacrifice, spent their entire life-force creating a tsunami to sweep over that island, trapping the Dragon Lords and their dragons forever in the rocky caverns below.
TELARIAN_HELM_SID=Telarian Helm
TELARIAN_HELM_USAGE_SID=the Telarian Helm
TELARIAN_ARMOURS_CODEX_SID=When the Elysians escaped the wrath of Aurelion, transporting themselves beneath the ocean of another, distant world, they brought with them Telari, the Cloudspire, the tower they had built to reach the heavens.  Cloaking it in great magics, they knew that despite their power, they were no match for the Nine.  And so they set up The Armourer at the base of the tower, where he waited patiently, creating splendid and perfect pieces of armour for the godslayer that they knew would inevitably come.  He created three things: a great, round shield, whose face detailed the world before the wave; a shining helm etched with creatures fantastic and long-extinct; and a mail-coat of such strength and lightness to put dragon-hide to shame.  Each of these he imbued with the essence of the divine and the dark, to ward against the forces the wearer must face above the peak of the tower, as they step out forever into the heavens.
AMULET_CARCASSIAN_EMPEROR_SID=Amulet of the Carcassian Emperor
AMULET_CARCASSIAN_EMPEROR_USAGE_SID=the Amulet of the Carcassian Emperor
AMULET_CARCASSIAN_EMPEROR_CODEX_SID=A symbol of the great empire of the central lands, the Amulet of the Carcassian Emperor is strangely plain given its exalted name.  A simple coin bearing an emperor's head and the motto "Empire Forever", it was minted during the early years of Carcassia.  The emperor Severan had it in his hand when an assassin broke into his bedchambers, and he flung it at the would-be killer, giving him enough time to grab a knife of his own and call for his guard.  After this, he had the coin enchanted by the great magics of the masters of the high tower.  Passed from emperor to emperor, it is often worn under the splendid royal clothes, offering an uncommon measure of protection from the knives and daggers that ended the lives of so many early emperors.
TWO_MOON_AMULET_SID=Amulet of the Two Moons
TWO_MOON_AMULET_USAGE_SID=the Amulet of the Two Moons
TWO_MOON_AMULET_CODEX_SID=The central lands are ruled by the Carcassian empire, enforced by ships and envoys from the Isle of Carcassia.  But influence fades with distance.  In the small islands and archipelagos far from the central lands, the empire's legitimacy is unrecognized, with the rulers and their systems of government as varied as the islands themselves.  One of these royal houses, on the cold eastern reaches, identified itself by the two moons, which were claimed as symbols after the marriage of two tribes creating a new ruling dynasty.  But this house is no longer, said to have been slaughtered during night-raids in the dead of winter, its few survivors left to drift in rafts and boats on the cold and cruel sea.
EUNOIA_SID=ruby amulet "Eunoia"
EUNOIA_USAGE_SID=the ruby amulet "Eunoia"
EUNOIA_CODEX_SID=In one of the old tongues, "eunoia" means, approximately "good thinking", or "well-minded"; and the amulet Eunoia, a small ruby hovering within concentric rings of gold and silver, was said to be granted by the god Vedere to the ancient fairy-king Tel on the eve of his army's ill-fated battle against the giants.  The decision to attack the giants with overwhelming force was made out of hubris and to press a perceived advantage, and thus scholars tend to agree that the amulet's name is ironic, and probably not original, though its original name in the fairy tongue has long since passed to dust.
SATIATIVE_AMULET_SID=satiative amulet
UNID_SATIATIVE_AMULET_SID=sparking amulet
SATIATIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a satiative amulet
UNID_SATIATIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a sparking amulet
SATIATIVE_AMULET_CODEX_SID=A world of sparsely-cast islands presents a number of challenges, one of which is hunger, presented by the scarcity of resources.  A traveller can spend many days, weeks, or months without encountering anyone else, alone in the world, and uncertain where to find a meagre meal.  And because of this, hedge wizards and sorcerors have created an ingenious solution, imbuing magical rings and amulets with metabolism-suppressing magics, allowing the wearers to cross great distances on very little food and water.  These have proven very popular among adventurers; one challenge among them involves eating a great quantity of food, putting on an amulet, and diving quickly through an ancient dungeon, marking on a wall the first time they had to cave and eat.
PROTECTIVE_AMULET_SID=protective amulet
UNID_PROTECTIVE_AMULET_SID=thrumming amulet
PROTECTIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a protective amulet
UNID_PROTECTIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a thrumming amulet
PROTECTIVE_AMULET_CODEX_SID=Those who venture out into the world always require a plan.  For the wilds are full of unfriendly things, people and creatures who kill for food or ivory or just plain enjoyment.  Armour offers a good measure of protection, but it's heavy; better still is a necklace that offers all the protection of mail while weighing little more than a lover's locket.  These are often found in treasure chests in dungeons, the prize of goblin and ogre chieftains, while others are made by spellstudents, collecting a tidy profit to help fund their studies.  Regardless of how they're acquired, they offer an element of surprise, and can turn aside daggers and spears thrust directly into a person, acting as a thick and second skin.
EVASIVE_AMULET_SID=evasive amulet
UNID_EVASIVE_AMULET_SID=tarnished amulet
EVASIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=an evasive amulet
UNID_EVASIVE_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a tarnished amulet
EVASIVE_AMULET_CODEX_SID=Imbued with repellant magics, evasive amulets contain a cantrip that can help turn aside danger.  While many travellers believe in the protection of layer upon layer of armour, there are many who believe that the best attack is the one that doesn't hit you in the first place.  Spooks and ghosts, ignoring the corporeal world, can cut through any armour, and there are tales of adventuring parties travelling deep into a dungeon only to be decimated by a powerful spirit, the tale of the escape told by the lone survivor, quick, agile, and underburdened.
HOLY_AMULET_SID=holy amulet
UNID_HOLY_AMULET_SID=golden amulet
HOLY_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a holy amulet
UNID_HOLY_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a golden amulet
HOLY_AMULET_CODEX_SID=Although it's thought that divine grace can only be given by the Nine themselves, this is demonstrably false.  Holy amulets, crafted by the priests and leaders of the religious orders, are able to capture a small sliver of divine will inside an ordinary necklace.  And this is powerful: the wearers are able to better weather divine wrath and holy fury, the essence of the amulet in effect bringing the wearer closer to the Nine themselves.  Some who have worn these report voices or visions, while others, alone in the wild, feel a unexplainable and comforting connection to everything else around them.
SHADOW_AMULET_SID=shadow amulet
UNID_SHADOW_AMULET_SID=dented amulet
SHADOW_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a shadow amulet
UNID_SHADOW_AMULET_USAGE_SID=an dented amulet
SHADOW_AMULET_CODEX_SID=Witchling magic, feared for its dark and terrifying intensity, is said by its practitioners to be the background energy of the universe.  In its purest form, it petrifies and rots, reducing the living to statues before crumbling into dust.  The fear of this, of slowly feeling one's limbs stiffen and life draining away, drives wayfarers to wear trinkets enchanted with the essence of shadow, and in this form, it provides protection against the same black energies.  The amulets are said to feel deeply uncomfortable: cold against the skin, not like something dead, but as if containing the lack of any kind of life at all.
LIGHTNING_AMULET_SID=lightning amulet
UNID_LIGHTNING_AMULET_SID=gleaming amulet
LIGHTNING_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a lightning amulet
UNID_LIGHTNING_AMULET_USAGE_SID=a gleaming amulet
LIGHTNING_AMULET_CODEX_SID=In its purest form, electricity seizes up the body, causing a temporary form of partial paralysis.  This is particular deadly when out in the wild, as a few minutes of immobility can prove deadly.  And so a solution was devised - a ward to help absorb the worst of the shock and allow the wearer to keep moving, keep breathing, and stay alive a little bit longer.  The elemental forces that drive the protection are unstable, and wearers are said to feel a number of different side-effects, including restless limbs, compulsive shuddering, and a kind of constant energy that makes sleep elusive and difficult.
CATARA_SID=shining amulet "Catara"
CATARA_USAGE_SID=the shining amulet "Catara"
CATARA_CODEX_SID=Back in the early days of the earth, veins of pure magic ran alongside iron and gold and silver; and when these veins crossed, a powerful alloy was formed.  One such alloy was used to forge the amulet Catara.  Having the sheen of gold and silver, and the strength of steel, it is heavy in the hand.  But the magics within present themselves strangely: reducing force, blunting steel, breaking wood.  The great protection offered by Catara has made it a precious but forgotten thing - worn by the greatest of the Elysians, it disappeared with the great flood, its record becoming a memory, a mention, a word, a whisper, and gone.
CALLUNA_SID=radiant amulet "Calluna"
CALLUNA_USAGE_SID=the radiant amulet "Calluna"
CALLUNA_CODEX_SID=The very essence of starlight, Calluna was created by the race of builders, the Elysians, while everything was strange and new.  At that time, a great magus made herself so tall as to be able to reach into the sky; and there, surrounded by the infinite cold of the cosmos, she extended her arms to the stars and drew the starlight towards her.  Once she shrunk back to her original size, her arms heavy and leaden, she took the precious light, cupped and concentrated in her hands, and fused it into a single form: a perfect sphere of intense, blue-green light.  It hovers in place at the throat, held in place neither by chain nor magic, but instead by some unknowable will of its own.  
AMULET_OF_THE_SEA_SID=amulet of the sea
AMULET_OF_THE_SEA_USAGE_SID=an amulet of the sea
AMULET_OF_THE_SEA_CODEX_SID=Before setting off on a long sea voyage, those with access may go see a hedge wizard.  For the seas are dangerous and unforgiving, and many who set out never come back again.  Increasing one's chances is the ability to breathe water.  This can be enchanted into a simple amulet as follows.  First, take an amulet made of a small shell, and whose chain is made of hemp.  Next, grind up a handful of fish bones, and seal them into the spell.  Finally, cast the old sea-speaking spell, whose knowledge is almost lost, and when wearing the shell around your neck, your throat will be open to both water and air.
CHAIN_SCRAPS_SID=chain mail scraps
CHAIN_SCRAPS_USAGE_SID=chain mail scraps
CHAIN_SCRAPS_CODEX_SID=While a full and fitted set of mail is highly prized among warriors, such a thing is expensive, and for a much more reasonable price (seizing pieces off dead goblins), one can make a reasonable approximation by stitching bits of mail to leather or layered cloth.  The result will win few beauty contests, but is still effective, and for this reason many adventurers, particularly those starting out, wear awkward and mis-matched armour, the cloth under-quilting visible through bits of poorly-applied mail, as they plan for the next dungeon, the next job, hoping to stay alive and upgrade their kit further.
CHAIN_MAIL_SID=chain mail
CHAIN_MAIL_USAGE_SID=a chain mail
CHAIN_MAIL_CODEX_SID=Formed of small rings linked together into a mesh, chain mail offers excellent protection depending on the method of construction.  Made poorly, it will stop most slashing attacks, but open easily to thrusting attacks.  Made well, and densely, it will weigh more but offer the wearer a tremendous advantage.  Despite its advantages, mail does not provide much against blunt attacks from a club or mace, and so it's often paired with some kind of padded armour underneath to soften these sorts of blows.
ELVEN_CHAIN_SID=elven chain
ELVEN_CHAIN_USAGE_SID=an elven chain mail
ELVEN_CHAIN_CODEX_SID=The process of smithing is well-known, but elven-kind is famous for combining it with their magics to create exceptional pieces of armour.  Their mail is aesthetically pleasing, appearing almost silver, and shimmering in the low light.  The pieces also weigh very little, barely more than a tunic and far less than the expectations for a coat of mail.  Because of this, many elven wizards wear mail-coats made by their kind, and the price commanded by these pieces is very steep indeed.
ALARIC_MAIL_SHIRT_SID=Alaric's mail shirt
ALARIC_MAIL_SHIRT_USAGE_SID=Alaric's mail shirt
ALARIC_MAIL_SHIRT_CODEX_SID=Knight-commander of the armies of Kell, Alaric wore a shining coat of mail blessed by the priests of Aurelion, The Lady, and Celeste.  His skill as a combatant and a general won Kell many victories, but he vanished from history abruptly.  His last mention was in the Kellurian histories, where he was to quell insurgencies at the edge of crescent.  Whether he was killed, or lost at sea in transit, is unknown at this time, as is the fate of his thrice-blessed mail.
PLATE_MAIL_TERROR_SID=smouldering black plate mail "Terror"
PLATE_MAIL_TERROR_USAGE_SID=the smouldering black plate mail "Terror"
PLATE_MAIL_TERROR_CODEX_SID=Many years after the great battle between the fair folk and the giants, while the world was gripped by chaos, a massive rift opened in the north-east passages of ice and snow.  From it poured demons from another plane of existence - not the physical world, not the celestial realm of the divine, not even the black cosmic prison of the dread thing Sceadugenga.  Their leader was Alturin, a sorceror whose two snake-heads whispered and hissed to conjure black magics never before seen.  He wore a set of black plate armour that smoked and smouldered, the joints pulsating orange-to-crimson.  Each of the races came together, for the first and only time as one, to defeat the demon hordes.  Alturin was cleaved in two at the waist by Haildi the dwarf, and at this the battle turned.  The demon forces retreated, closing the rift behind them; but as the many corpses rotted, the smouldering Terror remained, cast into the north sea to burn for all time within that black abyss.
BATTLE_ARMOUR_AURELION_SID=battle-armour of Aurelion
BATTLE_ARMOUR_AURELION_USAGE_SID=the battle-armour of Aurelion
BATTLE_ARMOUR_AURELION_CODEX_SID=When the race of builders created the fourth shrine, the shrine to the heavens, the Nine were enraged.  Seeing this as impudence and designs on immortality, they sent Aurelion to eliminate the Elysians.  Wearing battle-armour of his own creation, he descended from the heavens to shatter the great continent on which all life lived.  And as the earth rumbled the lands broke apart, a great wave washed over the world.  After this, he counted up the corpses, and found that a number of the Elysians escaped.  He threw his armour down in rage before ascending to the heavens, and it's said that it lay on the brine-soaked grasslands for thousands of years before it was discovered again.
DRAGON_LEATHER_TIUS_SID=dragon-leather armour of Tius
DRAGON_LEATHER_TIUS_USAGE_SID=the dragon-leather armour of Tius
DRAGON_LEATHER_TIUS_CODEX_SID=During the Dragon Age, the great Dragon Lords controlled much of the world.  This was an age of magic and great creatures, where it's said that dragons of various sizes were common as starlings.  During the battle against the Dragon Lord Pelageus, which ended the age, an elven bowman named Tius, standing his ground, took aim at a dragon overhead.  Firing a single arrow, he struck the creature perfectly, and it plunged to the earth.  It's said that as it crashed into the earth, its scales shattered and vanished, leaving the strange sight of a dragon lying bare-skinned on the earth.  Tius cut a length of its skin, and had this made into a breastplate of boiled leather.  This was held for generations by the wood elves of Tyrre, but at some point, like so many peoples in history, they vanished, leaving the splendid armour somewhere in the woods and wilds.
SILARI_SID=Atuan silver chain mail "Silari"
SILARI_USAGE_SID=the Atuan silver chain mail "Silari"
SILARI_CODEX_SID=Thought to be forged before the partition of the elves, Silari is perhaps the finest elven mail-coat ever created.  Named for the brightest star in the southern hemisphere, its many thousands of links pulse and glow with a faint light.  Thought to have been taken by the tribes who became the wood elves, it was recently found in an ossuary in Atua-Elar, proving to have been kept and forgotten by the mountain elves instead.
TELARIAN_MAIL_SID=Telarian Mail
TELARIAN_MAIL_USAGE_SID=the Telarian Mail
SHELL_ARMOUR_SID=shell armour
SHELL_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a shell armour
SHELL_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=The massive iron mollusc lives an abnormally long time.  Some have had their lives measured at over a hundred years, and in that time, it is not uncommon for them to grow as large as a small dog.  Over the years, their shells grow larger and larger, and these are prized for their exceptional strength.  Requiring diamond-tipped tools to break apart, the pieces of shell can be collected up and applied to strips of cloth or leather by adhesives.  The end result is a heavy but strong armour, one that can stand up to shattering blows and vicious hacks alike.
PLATE_ARMOUR_SID=plate armour
PLATE_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a plate armour
PLATE_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=While mail offers excellent protection, plate is better in almost every way.  Thrusting attacks are rendered ineffective, except where the spacing forms a joint, blunt attacks are dispersed better than mail, and slashing attacks are all but useless.  But all this comes at a cost.  Plate armour is heavy and reduces mobility, to say nothing of being expensive.  Because of this, it tends to be worn only by who can afford it and justify it, and its use tends to be restricted to warriors and generals of the noble classes.
STEEL_PLATE_ARMOUR_SID=steel plate armour
STEEL_PLATE_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a steel plate armour
STEEL_PLATE_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=While plate armour can be made of any metal, bronze and iron are typical, especially in areas that have not mastered steel production.  But steel is particularly desirable.  Able to be burnished to a brilliant shine, it easily blinds the rabble, drawing the eye to one's noble, god-like form; and certain alloys can also reduce rust and corrosion, requiring less upkeep and freeing up one's time to repress the peasantry, hunt storks, or whatever the hell it is rich people do.
DRAGONSCALE_ARMOUR_SID=dragonscale armour
DRAGONSCALE_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a dragonscale armour
DRAGONSCALE_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Holdovers of an age thousands of years gone, dragons are massive creatures, four-legged and reptilian, with a well-known love for gold.  But as valuable as their hoard is their skin.  Dragon leather is thin and light, covered by overlapping scales that themselves weigh surprisingly little.  These scales are strong as steel, flexible, and snap back to their original shape.  When formed into armour, the resultant piece is durable, allows for full range of movement, and can withstand great heat.  Dragonscale is coveted by many, but there are so few extant suits, and dragons so stubbornly difficult to kill, that it is almost impossible to buy, and must be found, often within ancient, dangerous, and uncharted places.
LEVIATHAN_ARMOUR_SID=leviathan armour
LEVIATHAN_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a leviathan armour
LEVIATHAN_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Leviathans live deep within sea-trenches, unseen for much of their lives.  But they rise with the storms, and when they emerge, they break the surface violently, crackling with energy, appearing to ill-fated sailors as the embodiment of the hurricane's eye.  Only one of these creatures is known to have been killed, a young beast that was still as long as a trireme, and the sailors who did so made armour, cloaks, and clothing out of lengths of its hide.  They found that it seemed to provide a strange luck.  Warding off storms and bad weather, it allowed them to cross long stretches of open sea in peace.  Whether intrinsic or coincidental, this property became famous, to the point where many nervous first-time seadogs have been tricked into buying strips of what they think is leviathan-leather, but which instead just comes from rats behind the pub.
COLOSSUS_ARMOUR_SID=colossus armour
COLOSSUS_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a colossus armour
COLOSSUS_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Colossi are animated by magic, and when slain do not fully revert to inert stone.  Before the magic fades, they shed their stone-skin, and the cooling magics allow it to form and harden around the body of the wearer.  While extremely heavy, and worn only by the strongest warriors, it ensures that the wearer is all but invincible against conventional attacks.  The stony skin absorbs and disspirates massive amounts of force; one legend holds that Boral, the ogre-chief, took a direct hit from a boulder hurled by a catapult, and that instead of being crushed to a bloody pulp, he was merely knocked back a step.
MOLOCH_ARMOUR_SID=moloch armour
MOLOCH_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a moloch armour
MOLOCH_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Forged by the black smiths of the demon-plane, moloch armour is worn by the mute demons who give the armour its name.  Dwarfing giants and ogres, molochs stand half as tall as titans.  Their armour is made of smouldering black steel, with plates so thick as to be unwearable by almost everyone.  So infused with primordial magic is the suit that it seems to dim the light around it, softening sound and betraying its provenance as a thing from another world.
TARASQUE_ARMOUR_SID=tarasque armour
TARASQUE_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a tarasque armour
TARASQUE_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=The hide of the fearsome tarasque is coveted for the armour it can create; unlike the dragon, whose skin provides protection against great heat, tarasque-leather is dense and heavy, and once boiled, hardens into a substance thicker than metal.  Tarasques are rare, living deep inside the earth, and have been recorded as tearing apart great sorcerors and mighty champions.  Because of this, tarasque hide is altogether unavailable, passed down by kings, or found in dragons' hoards.
ROBES_SID=robe
ROBES_USAGE_SID=a robe
ROBES_CODEX_SID=Robes come in all shapes and sizes, from religious robes worn by priests and officials, to travelling garments, to sheer and sexy examples that are wholly unsuitable for adventuring.  Most common robes are made from either wool or cotton.  Cheap and practical, they are worn by men and women alike, though typically only in domestic life, as they are not particularly effective when running away or fighting for your life.
ELVEN_ROBES_SID=elven robe
ELVEN_ROBES_USAGE_SID=an elven robe
ELVEN_ROBES_CODEX_SID=Woven from whiteflower and threads of precious metals, elven fabrics exude stateliness and nobility.  The elves were the first people to discover a method of permanently imparting silver into thread, and after doing so, experimented with weaving these with cotton into bolts of cloth.  These then made their way from elven lands on trading ships, sold to coastal communities in exchange for ivory and magici.  After careful tailoring, the finished product graces the bodies of priests and magistrates, kings and queens.
WIZARD_ROBES_SID=wizard robe
WIZARD_ROBES_USAGE_SID=a wizard robe
WIZARD_ROBES_CODEX_SID=The high tower of Carcassia is famous for the wizards it produces.  It's said to have existed long before Carcassia itself, a relic of the ancient towns and cities over which Carcassia is built, and those who train at the school are instantly identifiable by the cowled, dark grey robes they wear.  Despite their austere appearance, these robes are warded with cantrips and arcane magics, which in addition to protecting the wearer also have a practical purpose, eliminating dirt and sweat, requiring no washing and very little care.
MAGIC_ARMOUR_SID=magic armour
MAGIC_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a magic armour
MAGIC_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=The hedge wizards who study outside the high tower have their own magics.  Less showy than the arcane mastery of the grey-cloaked wizards, it is a simplified form of magic, rooted in everyday things and deeply practical.  One of these spells concerns the enchantment of armour, causing blades and thrusts to miss, guided away by some unseen force.  This is typically cast on a leather cuirass, which are in abundant supply and relatively cheap, and though the process can take a week or more, layering ward upon ward, the finished product can double the price of the armour, creating a tidy profit for the caster.
ETHEREAL_ARMOUR_SID=ethereal armour
ETHEREAL_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=an ethereal armour
ETHEREAL_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Imbued with the essence of other planes of existence, ethereal armour flickers.  When worn, it causes the wearer to step in between planes, existing for a moment in a strange cosmos of colour and light.  When this happens, the wearer seems to disappear, and any attacks simply pass through where they used to be.  Some wearers find the experience deeply unsettling, and most find themselves changed, experiencing visual and auditory hallucinations, finding sleep difficult, their minds replaying the experience again and again, even when the armour is long-gone.
SPIRIT_MAIL_SID=spirit mail
SPIRIT_MAIL_USAGE_SID=a spirit mail
SPIRIT_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=In a world full of dangers, who, physically, protects the church?  Priests and monks largely lack the training or means, and so they instead rely on those parishioners whose devotion and experience lends itself to the task.  In exchange, religious leaders provide what help they can, blessing arms and armour in the name of the Nine.  These then take on an element of the celestial, humming with holy energy and crackling with the electrical forces of the border to the world above.
CHIMERA_HIDE_SID=chimera hide armour
CHIMERA_HIDE_USAGE_SID=a chimera hide armour
CHIMERA_HIDE_CODEX_SID=The chimera is a strange beast, thought to be formed by magic, with the heads of a snake, a goat, and a lion extruding from its massive frame.  Its body is a patchwork of each individual creature, and its skin is said to have been worn by the nameless heroes of the Wolf Age, who fought great beasts to find fame and live on in eternity.  Sadly, the history of these heroes is all but lost, fragments of it found written in runes carved on crosses and outcroppings, thousands of years of history reduced to just a handful of surviving words.
ABYSSAL_HIDE_SID=abyssal hide armour
ABYSSAL_HIDE_USAGE_SID=an abyssal hide armour
ABYSSAL_HIDE_CODEX_SID=Abyssal beasts, the possible ancestors of ogres, rise from the marshlands at night to feed on bloody terror.  Their skin is covered in a red-black fur, which insulates as well as bear- or wolf-pelts; the head, when left in place, gives one the terrifying appearance of the creature itself, the skin taking an empty, ghost-like form, gliding like a spirit on the wind.
BEHEMOTH_HIDE_SID=behemoth hide armour
BEHEMOTH_HIDE_USAGE_SID=a behemoth hide armour
BEHEMOTH_HIDE_CODEX_SID=Behemoths live at the fringes of the world, perhaps a holdover from a previous ice age.  Even more massive than dragons, they are covered by a strange mix of fur and scales, perhaps a kind of evolutionary ending-point.  In the archives in Carcassia, long strips of behemoth-hide are carefully preserved.  Hundreds of years ago, they flew from flagpoles as a sign of the empire's might - but like all natural things, they began to break down over time, and so they were taken down to be carefully preserved.
CLOTHES_SID=clothes
CLOTHES_USAGE_SID=clothes
CLOTHES_CODEX_SID=The simplest armour is the clothing on one's back.  This does not provide any real protection, however, and is typically discarded as soon as a better option becomes available.  But while not particularly useful in a dungeon or out in the wilds, it does allow one to move about in urban life without the fear of being socially ostracized as a nudist, and apart from nudists, most would agree that this is a useful thing.
WAYFARER_CLOTHES_SID=wayfarer's clothes
WAYFARER_CLOTHES_USAGE_SID=wayfarer's clothes
WAYFARER_CLOTHES_CODEX_SID=Made from a more durable fabric than most clothes, wayfarer clothes are designed to be useful when travelling long distances.  The pants contain a number of deep pockets, and the shirts typically also have a hood to provide a bit of relief from heat or rain.  In more dangerous areas where bandits are common, the clothes will often be dyed a mottled green-brown, allowing the wearer to blend in well against grasses and underbrush.
LINOTHORAX_SID=linothorax
LINOTHORAX_USAGE_SID=a linothorax
LINOTHORAX_CODEX_SID=A breastplate of layered linen, glued together to become rigid, the linothorax is a simple piece of armour, but effective.  The layering of the cloth allows it a strength somewhere close to metal, and can deflect arrows and turn away swords.  More importantly, it cheap to manufacture, and lighter and cooler than mail, and these factors have ensured its popularity with both soldiers and adventurers alike.
LEATHER_ARMOUR_SID=leather armour
LEATHER_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=a leather armour
LEATHER_ARMOUR_CODEX_SID=Leather is cheap and easy to work.  Once boiled, it becomes quite hard, while still remaining light enough to move around easily.  Leather thus remains popular among adventurers, particularly those starting out.  Lacking the wealth to purchase a suit of mail, they instead make do with leather, perhaps augmenting it along the way with bands or plates of metal, each wearer's set over time becoming uniquely their own.
HIDE_ARMOUR_SID=%s-hide armour
HIDE_ARMOUR_USAGE_SID=%s-hide armour
BUCKLER_SID=buckler
BUCKLER_USAGE_SID=a buckler
BUCKLER_CODEX_SID=Held by the fist and covering an area not much larger than the hand, the buckler is a light metal shield used in hand-to-hand combat to deflect incoming strikes.  Its light weight allows it to be used quickly, and its small size allows the wearer full view of the combat.  In a pinch, it also becomes a useful weapon of its own, as a full-on punch with a buckler is as effective as hitting one's opponent with a mace or club.
MAGIC_SHIELD_SID=magic shield
MAGIC_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=a magic shield
MAGIC_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=Typically made from a simple wooden shield, magic shields are warded by cantrips to repel attacks and make the wearer difficult to strike.  Though wooden shields are seen by some as primitive, and tend to make one look ridiculous next to professional soldiers, they have the practical value of responding well to magic, and holding it easily.  Nicer examples of this kind of armour are often made from striking figured woods, particularly tropical ones, though everyday examples are made from cheap and plentiful sources, such as poplar, ash, or pine.
SPIRIT_SHIELD_SID=spirit shield
SPIRIT_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=a spirit shield
ELEMENTAL_SHIELD_SID=elemental shield
ELEMENTAL_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=an elemental shield
ELEMENTAL_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=Saturated with arcane magics, elemental shields contain the essence of fire, ice, and electricity, and this allows them to ward against these elements.  These shields are especially popular among wizards, who during their studies learn the principles required to create one of their own.  While still effective against a sword or axe, the shield's internal resistances are useful when staring down a wizard whose offensive magics are largely based on the same forces.
FAERIE_SHIELD_SID=Faerie Shield
FAERIE_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=the Faerie Shield
FAERIE_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=The Faerie Shield is so-called because there is no other known name for it.  Unattested in history and literature, it is a strange thing, full of old magics.  Its face is full of the glamour of the old fae, and shows a scene that loops endlessly: a company of soldiers, dressed in bright mail, exiting a fairy mound.  Dressed in bright mail and carrying swords and spears, they march on to some kind of fate, walking wordlessly for several seconds before the scene abruptly repeats.
TELARIAN_SHIELD_SID=Telarian Shield
TELARIAN_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=the Telarian Shield
WYRM_WARD_SID=dwarven shield "Wyrm-Ward"
WYRM_WARD_USAGE_SID=the dwarven shield "Wyrm-Ward"
WYRM_WARD_CODEX_SID=The work of the great smith Thengil, Wyrm Ward was forged in the great fires of Stoneheim.  Deep in the mines below the city, the dwarves found a deposit of tungsten, and Thengil combined this with steel to create a masterpiece.  Ringed with lapis lazuli and red shards of magici, the shield has a hypnotic red-blue appearance, and it is said that Skaal, the chief who commissioned the shield, has kept it in safekeeping for a full hundred years, waiting for the appearance of a person worthy of wearing it.
IRON_SHIELD_SID=iron shield
IRON_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=an iron shield
IRON_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=Most shields are made of some combination of wood and animal hides.  These provide good-enough protection, and are cheap to manufacture and repair.  But those who can afford it have shields made of iron.  More difficult to damage, these provide stability and predictability, important factors when fighting for one's life.  Often times these are punctuated by a centre spike or boss, which can be used to impale or batter one's opponent, allowing the shield to double as a second weapon.
KITE_SHIELD_SID=kite shield
KITE_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=a kite shield
KITE_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=A popular style of shield with the elves, kite shields take their name from the resemblance to everyday kites.  These stand almost the full height of a man, and taper towards the bottom to a teardrop shape.  Unlike bucklers or smaller, rounded shields, kite shields provide the advantage of protecting most of the body.  When planted, they hide much of the body, useful in the moments before a battle when archers loose a hail of arrows into the air.
DRAGON_SHIELD_SID=dragon shield
DRAGON_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=a dragon shield
DRAGON_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=Dragon scales are precious things.  When not enough are available to make into a full suit of armour, the alternative is to work with smaller pieces, such as shields.  The rarity of dragon-skin makes these deeply coveted.  Glistening and gleaming as if still alive, the scales flare and glow when exposed to heat, storing the energy as in the belly of a dragon.  This gradually, over the course of days, will dissipate, but until then emits a low and unearthly glow, lighting the path through caverns that snake to the dragon's lair.
TOWER_SHIELD_SID=tower shield
TOWER_SHIELD_USAGE_SID=a tower shield
TOWER_SHIELD_CODEX_SID=A flat, rectangular shield standing anywhere between five and six feet tall, the tower shield covers the majority of the holder's body, requiring only a slight crouch to be shielded completely.  Due to the size, they are typically made from wicker and hide, interlaced with steel, rather than from a single sheet of metal.  Interlocking the shields allows for mobile, armoured formations, and entire books have been written on the tactics of moving as a single shield-wall, bristling with pikes and spears.
CLOAK_SID=cloak
CLOAK_USAGE_SID=a cloak
CLOAK_CODEX_SID=Cloaks are a practical piece of clothing, worn by travellers in inclement weather.  Longer than a cape, they wrap around the body and typically feature a deep hood to keep rain and snow away from the face.  The simplest ones are generally made of a light fabric, though fur-lined cloaks enjoy popularity in colder climates.  In a nod to practicality, they often feature pockets sewn on the inside, whether for money, prized possessions or weapons such as daggers or darts.
CALARA_CLOAK_SID=Calara's cloak
CALARA_CLOAK_USAGE_SID=Calara's cloak
CALARA_CLOAK_CODEX_SID=Calara's cloak was originally a light grey colour, made of a thick, rough wool.  Now irregularly stained deep red, the fabric has been torn and punctured by a number of blades.
HIDE_CLOAK_SID=%s-hide cloak
HIDE_CLOAK_USAGE_SID=%s-hide cloak
HUNTERS_CLOAK_SID=hunter's cloak
HUNTERS_CLOAK_USAGE_SID=a hunter's cloak
HUNTERS_CLOAK_CODEX_SID=While most cloaks are worn for warmth or protection from the rain, hunters wear cloaks designed to let them blend into their environment.  Grass-stained, rolled through muck and gravel, these cloaks are typically also decorated with tufts of grass or shrubberies, so that when the wearer is crouched, they appear to the unwary eye as part of the surroundings.  This then allows them the advantage of surprise and potentially a first strike, letting them loose an arrow or spear from what appears to be an empty and safe landscape.
HEAVY_CLOAK_SID=heavy cloak
HEAVY_CLOAK_USAGE_SID=a heavy cloak
HEAVY_CLOAK_CODEX_SID=Made from pliable leather, banded with thin strips of steel, heavy cloaks are more armour than clothing.  Meant to be surreptitious, the banding is typically sewn inside the cloak.  Depending on the amount of it used, the cloaks can become quite heavy and fall awkwardly around the body; because of this, usually only a few bands are used, and they tend to be quite thin, spaced far enough apart so as to minimize any sounds caused by the bands striking each other.  These sorts of cloaks are popular among thieves, and there is more than one story of a dagger to the back being suddenly stopped by a strip of well-placed steel.
WINTERSEA_MANTLE_SID=Wintersea Mantle
WINTERSEA_MANTLE_USAGE_SID=the Wintersea Mantle
WINTERSEA_MANTLE_CODEX_SID=Dyed a deep purple, and fringed with polar bear fur, the Wintersea Mantle is regal and altogether out of place with where it was found.  Found buried beneath the rotting foundation stones at Wintersea Keep in the far south-east, the mantle was packed away carefully in oilskins.  It remains a mystery, relic of an unrecorded time, reflecting the brilliant craftsmanship of a people who have long since passed from the world.
HOLY_MANTLE_SID=holy mantle
HOLY_MANTLE_USAGE_SID=a holy mantle
HOLY_MANTLE_CODEX_SID=A religious garment typically worn by a priest, holy mantles are a sign of religious office.  These are dyed with the colours associated with a particular deity, and decorated accordingly - mantles of Celeste are inlaid with diamonds and sapphires, while Voros' are fringed with dragon-scales.  Once made, the mantles are blessed and imbued with the breath of the divine, so that when giving blessings and benedictions, the wearer is wreathed with holy light.
GILDIS_CLOAK_SID=Gildi's Cloak
GILDIS_CLOAK_USAGE_SID=Gildi's Cloak
GILDIS_CLOAK_CODEX_SID=Woven from rough wool, dyed a matte black with coal tar, Gildi's cloak is an unassuming masterpiece.  Covered with spells and enchantments from every sphere of magic, in the darkness it emits a strange blue light.  It catches in the slightest breeze, maneuvering about the torso, tightening and loosening.  The deep hood completely obscures the head, and within it are strange sounds - whispers, as if from a previous age, strange side effects of the magics set into the raw cloth before weaving.  The voices know the wearer's name; call it softly, call it desperately, pleading for their impossible release.
CYNEHILD_SHROUD_SID=Cynehild's Shroud
CYNEHILD_SHROUD_USAGE_SID=Cynehild's Shroud
CYNEHILD_SHROUD_CODEX_SID=When the Isenlings arrived at Little Island, they wintered in the ruins of a keep that stood watch over the north-west shores.  And after the first winter, a grim one that took six lives, they set about the business of making a village at the edge of the world.  The first chief was Wulf; and his mystic was the witch Cynehild, who supplemented her primordial powers with potions and charms.  When Wulf died, Cynehild was sacrificed with him, to follow him into the afterlife.  Wrapped in a linen shroud, she was burned on a funeral pyre with him.  But though the flames took their bodies, the shroud remained, untouched, forever keeping her impression on the cloth.
SHROUD_FATE_SID=Shroud of Fate
SHROUD_FATE_USAGE_SID=the Shroud of Fate
SHROUD_FATE_CODEX_SID=The fae have mentioned an artifact of pre-history, a shroud found deep in the earth, surrounding the body of a strange, humanoid creature.  They said that their ancestors, the fair folk, took the shroud for their archive, and re-interred the bones.  Some number of generations later, they became curious about the uncovered bones, and the strange, stocky, small-headed creature they belonged to.  Retracing their way, they found the cavern, but the bones were gone; and later, after returning to the archive, they found the shroud vanished as well.
LEATHER_BOOTS_SID=leather boots
LEATHER_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of leather boots
LEATHER_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Leather boots are a cheap and practical piece of footwear.  Most shoemakers will produce a pair for a few ivories, though the quality of the materials and the number of years of wear can vary dramatically.  Covering the foot and running anywhere from the ankle to the knee or hip, a good pair of boots will keep dirt and water off clothing and protect the feet.  When properly sealed, they can allow waterproof movement through puddles, shallow creeks, and snow, and are preferred by most travellers to shoes or walking barefoot.
HIDE_BOOTS_SID=%s-hide boots
HIDE_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=%s-hide boots
THIEFS_BOOTS_SID=thief's boots
THIEFS_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of thief's boots
THIEFS_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Needing to move in absolute silence, thieves treat their boots in a number of ways to muffle the noise and conceal their movement.  Some replace the leather soles with rubber, while others apply thin pieces of adhesive paper tape, or glue bits of felt or cloth underneath.  The end result isn't much to look at, but most scoundrels will happily trade fashion for a bit of opportune silence.
MAGIC_BOOTS_SID=magic boots
MAGIC_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of magic boots
MAGIC_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Sometimes, a few light charms can save your life.  Placed on boots, these wards give them a life of their own.  Looking like any other piece of battered footwear, magic boots flare to life under duress, moving under their own will to pull the wearer away from danger.  Stories have even been told of those who, leaping over a pit or chasm, have been carried effortlessly far beyond their natural trajectory, landing safely on the other side.
IRON_BOOTS_SID=iron boots
IRON_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of iron boots
IRON_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Builders and those involved with construction often wear boots reinforced with a bit of iron or steel in key places to protect the feet.  Taken to an extreme conclusion, the result is the awkward piece of footwear known as iron boots.  Heavy and restrictive, iron boots sheathe the feet in a solid half-inch of iron.  These extend a little past the ankle, but not much, as any higher and most people would not be able to move at all.
STEEL_BOOTS_SID=steel boots
STEEL_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of steel boots
STEEL_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Similar to iron boots, steel boots are heavy boots made out of solid metal.  But unlike iron boots, which suffer from rusting and other problems, steel boots are made from a high-grade steel that resists corrosion.  This allows the boots to last much longer, and prevents having to wrap the feet in cloth to avoid rust, tetanus, and other problems.  Because of this, steel boots are the footwear of choice among heavy infantry, who cover themselves with as much metal as they can in the hopes of surviving and living to see their loved ones once again.
KNIGHTS_BOOTS_SID=knight's boots
KNIGHTS_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of knight's boots
KNIGHTS_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=Designed to offer excellent protection along with good mobility, knight's boots consist of two parts: an inner, soft leather boot, designed for comfort; and an outer shell of banded steel.  The steel bands are laced together, and have enough give that the wearer can move easily.  Often worn by cavalry, this allows the rider to comfortably ride a war-horse, and also remain suitably protected if forced to dismount and fight on foot.
DRAGON_BOOTS_SID=dragon boots
DRAGON_BOOTS_USAGE_SID=a pair of dragon boots
DRAGON_BOOTS_CODEX_SID=It's said that dragonscale is rarer than dragons themselves.  There is very little of it still in use; during the Dragon Age, when the great beasts passed naturally or were slain, people could make a tidy profit off a few square feet, and a fortune off the entire skin.  But as millennia passed, the number of dragons dwindled, and so too did good quality hide still covered in scales.  Larger pieces were turned to cuirasses and great shields, but smaller pieces could be fashioned by a skilled shoemaker into a strking set of boots.  Often fashioned into the shape of dragon's feet, these allow the wearer to withstand great heat, and when worn as a full set of armour, transform the warrior into a terrifying, draconian figure.
SHOES_SID=shoes
SHOES_USAGE_SID=a pair of shoes
SHOES_CODEX_SID=Shoes can be made out of a variety of materials, and take a variety of styles, from leather dress shoes worn by the nobility and elite, to the simple cloth shoes worn by the poor.  The styles fluctuate dramatically around the tastes of the Carcassian Empire, and ripple outwards; because of travel times and slow communication, many styles from hundreds of years ago (or earlier!) are still current in certain parts of the world.  Most travellers, though, prefer something sturdy, wearing leather shoes of some style with layered leather or rubber soles, largely standardized to allow for later repair.
AKOS_AKARI_SID=legendary boots "Akos Akari"
AKOS_AKARI_USAGE_SID=the legendary boots "Akos Akari"
AKOS_AKARI_CODEX_SID=In a myth almost as old as the world itself, there was a spear-woman named Akos Akari who it was said was faster than anyone else alive.  Having challenged everyone she met, and won, she despaired to ever face a real challenge in a footrace.  From the heavens, the goddess Shiver decided to toy with the woman, and sent a frost-spirit to challenge Akos Akari to a race over the tallest mountains.  Akos Akari accepted.  The next day, Akos Akari and the spirit set out.  As Akos Akari ran, and climbed, the wind carried the spirit up and around the mountains, lashing the peaks, before arriving at the agreed-upon meeting point on the other side.  But to its shock, Akos Akari stood there, encrusted in frost and snow; and then she laughed, shaking off her winter coat.  It's said the earth shook and screamed: her victory humbled Shiver herself, who smote her with a massive lance of ice.  Akos Akari's body vanished, and in the spot where she stood, there remained only her well-worn pair of boots.
BRASS_KNUCKLES_SID=brass knuckles
BRASS_KNUCKLES_USAGE_SID=brass knuckles
BRASS_KNUCKLES_CODEX_SID=A bit of brass or iron that slips over the fingers, brass knuckles concentrate the force of a punch into a much smaller area, causing deep tissue damage, bone fractures, and other serious injury.  They are light, simple, and effective.  Many pugilists rely on them as they learn the in and outs of street fighting, though because they can be easily concealed in one's pockets, they are seen as classless in many quarters.  That said, those who use them find them useful enough to put any stigmas to the back of the mind.
SPIKED_GLOVE_SID=spiked glove
SPIKED_GLOVE_USAGE_SID=a spiked glove
SPIKED_GLOVE_CODEX_SID=A fighting weapon several steps above brass knuckles, spiked gloves are heavy leather gloves, often elbow-length, with sharp, studded spikes along the knuckles and the back of the hand.  Known in some quarters as the gloved mace, they inflict less blunt force trauma than brass knuckles, but make a mess of the skin: a solid, twisting punch or sweeping backhand can shred a large section of skin, inducing heavy bleeding and allowing the attacker to wait patiently until blood loss takes its toll.
IRON_CLAW_SID=iron claw
IRON_CLAW_USAGE_SID=an iron claw
IRON_CLAW_CODEX_SID=First crafted by the wood elves, iron claws are weighted gloves with three claws that stretch a foot or more.  The wood elves claim these have their origin in their martial arts, though owing to the usefulness and fearsome appearance, their use has become widely spread.  Their most famous proponent would be Vaedra of Tol Alun, a hot-headed young woman who a hundred years ago conquered the Carcassian fighting pits wearing a pair of iron claws.  She won her final victory against the witchling O, dodging his eldritch magic to finally land her claws in through his eyes.
IRON_HAMMER_SID=iron hammer
IRON_HAMMER_USAGE_SID=an iron hammer
IRON_HAMMER_CODEX_SID=Hammers are practical, used by all sorts of professions, from smiths to framers to stonecutters.  They're cheap to make, and iron hammers need only a small hammerhead to be effective.  Usually wood-hafted, they serve as effective combat weapons as well, inflicting terrible wounds, even through light armour.  Internal bleeding kills slowly; broken bones incapacitate; and a strike to the unprotected head can crush the skull, driving bits of bone into the brain to leave the defender dead before they fall.
DAGGER_SID=dagger
DAGGER_USAGE_SID=a dagger
DAGGER_CODEX_SID=Daggers are double-edged knives suitable for slashing or thrusting, and can be anywhere from a few inches long to a foot or more.  Smaller daggers are favoured as a quick means of defense because of the ease of concealment, as well as the utility - everyone can claim to need a knife.  Most soldiers will wear one strapped inside a boot, a last line of defense after their spears are thrown, and sword is knocked away.
ATHAME_SID=athame
ATHAME_USAGE_SID=an athame
ATHAME_CODEX_SID=Ritual daggers used in magic, particularly among mystics and witchlings, athames are made unnaturally sharp by cantrips passed down from teacher to student, from colleague to colleague.  Hedge wizards cast spells of sharpening to keep them atom-thin, sharper than can be achieved by a whetstone and oil.  These spells, by some sort of natural sympathy, bind easily to metals, and athames remain sharp without maintenance for years, even generations, after the initial cantrip has been cast.
ATHAME_WINTER_SID=frost-covered athame "Winter"
ATHAME_WINTER_USAGE_SID=the frost-covered athame "Winter"
ATHAME_WINTER_CODEX_SID=In the earliest days of the world, when the great continent was covered with fantastic beasts, it was a time of eternal summer.  The goddess Shiver saw the imbalance in the new lands, and she clashed with Vedere, but could not impose her will upon him.  So she, a creature of pure cunning, enacted her plan through his own creations.  She descended into the great forests, felt by the animals as a cool wind on a mild mid-summer day.  And after watching two stag-men quarrel, she presented one of them with a long, thin knife.  He instantly plunged this into his companion, and as the beast died, the erupting blood turned to snow.  The air became full of snowflakes, covering the land with a thick blanket of snow, and so began an equally long period of winter.  From this emerged the cycle of seasons, born out of the divine struggle between life and death, good and evil.
FATEBENDER_SID=queer dagger "Fatebender"
FATEBENDER_USAGE_SID=the queer dagger "Fatebender"
FATEBENDER_CODEX_SID=A long, sharp piece of iron, wrapped carefully at one end with leather, Fatebender is oracular and truth-telling, clearer than any of the oracles who have ever walked the world, more knowing than the divine.  For while the Nine possess immense power, they have no understanding of the future beyond general terms and the ways in which they influence the present.  Fatebender shows its holder glimpses of the future, near and far.  Its shadow, viewed peripherally, plays out scenes of what will come - the wielder's own life and death; that of the surrounding lands, empires current and to come; and finally, the world itself, incinerated in the heavenly heat of a dying and rapidly expanding star.
AKKAR_SID=thief's knife "Akkar"
AKKAR_USAGE_SID=the thief's knife "Akkar"
AKKAR_CODEX_SID=Thousands of years ago, before the wyrm Amaurosis laid waste to the dwarven kingdom now known as Wyrmeswraec, there lived a great dwarven-king named Thorian.  Thorian, it's said, ordered the creation of deeper and deeper mines, digging almost to the centre of the world, so great was his love of gold.  The gold he mined he kept in great vaults beneath Wyrmeswraec, and when he died, he was buried there, the vaults protected by black, wraith-like sentinels called the Watchers.  After the devastation of Wyrmeswraec, many tried to find a way in.  Some tried to dig alternative approaches, but found their passages collapse under tricky dwarven traps.  But the thief Akkar, it's said, simply walked in, filling his pockets and satchels with gold before the rigged door collapsed with him inside.  And yet, he escaped, claiming to have brought with him a knife from the spirit realm, identifying him as one of the dead, allowing him safely past the Watchers and then through the door that would have sealed him in.
SHORT_SWORD_SID=short sword
SHORT_SWORD_USAGE_SID=a short sword
SHORT_SWORD_CODEX_SID=Broadswords and greatswords are attention-grabbing: long and impressive, equally at home in combat and as a sign of office and authority.  But the humble short sword - longer and heftier than a dagger, but still light and quick - has likely killed far more.  Their weight and balance makes them equally suitable for stabbing or slashing, while their size allows for their use even in very close quarters.  Whole books of tactics have been drawn up around the use of a shield and short sword, and these, along with long darts or javelins, comprise the weaponry used by the soldiers of the mighty Carcassian army.
LORA_SID=august longbow "Lora"
LORA_USAGE_SID=the august longbow "Lora"
LORA_CODEX_SID=Legend tells of a knight's tournament called by an emperor of the great Kell Empire, and how men travelled from far and wide to participate in its events, for the winner was to be allowed to name their prize.  Before the final round, archery, the scores were tied: a great and celebrated knight, hailing from a nearby kingdom; and a tall green man, whose arrival no one seemed to remember, and whose clothing was covered in moss and grass, his long beard full of twigs and songbirds.  The emperor had them fire their bows into the great forest of Kell; whoever fired the furthest shot would be declared champion.  The princeling's shot arced high above the forest, eventually landing halfway in.  The green man then quietly cut a yew branch, produced a length of bowstring, and strung it.  Then taking a single arrow, he fired level.  The shot flew through the entire forest, avoiding every tree and shrub, eventually landing on the other side.  The green man bowed before the emperor, and as his prize, took the emperor's baby girl, still wrapped in swaddling clothes, the two of them departing into the forest, never to be heard from again.
FORGER_SID=blackened hammer "Forger"
FORGER_USAGE_SID=the blackened hammer "Forger"
FORGER_CODEX_SID=Made of impure bog iron and infused with the energy of the Sun Gem, Forger is the creation of an anonymous blacksmith from the tribe of the Isenlings, who live in the south-east corner of the world.  Driven by talk of a recent publication of a colloquy on the occupations, one in which a fictional ploughman is placed on a pedestal for his role in providing food for society, the blacksmith poured his rage and skill into his forge.  The end result is Forger, a great hammer which can just as easily crush steel as hammer it into beautiful new shapes.
BRIGHTBLADE_SID=shining greatsword "Brightblade"
BRIGHTBLADE_USAGE_SID=the shining greatsword "Brightblade"
BRIGHTBLADE_CODEX_SID=Years ago, a once-great imperial house was set into turmoil: having waned for decades, its former farmlands barren and facing ever-shorter growing seasons, it was at last put to the sword when one winter night, a number of raiding ships settled into a deep, rocky harbour near the keep.  Coming for what little was left in the treasury, the pirates marched up the beaches carrying torches and axes, ready to hack apart the remnants of a once-proud royal line.  While the torches approached, the heirs to the house, a boy and his baby sister, were bundled into a rowboat, and pushed out lightless on the sea.  Along with hard loaves of bread, packed salt fish, and plenty of water, they were given a few other items in case they should find land and survive.  The girl carried an amulet showing two moons, a traditional symbol of the family, while the boy was given an ancient sword, called Brightblade, which unsheathed is said to burn as bright as the mid-day sun.
IRONSWORD_SID=imperial broadsword "Ironsword"
IRONSWORD_USAGE_SID=the imperial broadsword "Ironsword"
IRONSWORD_CODEX_SID=On a small island, tucked away in the south-east corner of the world, an ancient and desolate keep watches over the frost-cold seas.  The vestige of some former people or empire, its original builder is not known.  The Isenlings, who had come to the island several hundred years ago, said that the keep was there and in ruins when they came, and that they spent their first winter sheltered inside its walls.  In the top of the keep, hidden behind locked iron gates, were a number of treasures from the long-forgotten empire.  One of these was Ironsword, a plain broadsword with no identifying features save for a pale blue light that can be seen as a dim beacon, calling nearby ships in to the shores.
CHOROS_GREATSWORD_SID=Greatsword of Choros
CHOROS_GREATSWORD_USAGE_SID=the Greatsword of Choros
CHOROS_GREATSWORD_CODEX_SID=Mentioned in the epic poem "Tel and Floridel", the sword of the giant Choros is described as "...a seventeen foot blade, a cleaver forged / with breathless skill..."  Wielded by the warrior Choros against Tel, then the prince of the fair folk, it was hurled against the reinforcements that came to the aid of the prince, cleaving three men apart before Choros turned to face the rest in a final, fatal showdown.  He killed the fairy king, smashing his face in, before being cut down by the dead king's riders.  Those who see the poem as history see the thrown greatsword as a massive blunder, noting that even though Choros was desperately injured at the time, he likely would have stood a greater chance had he faced down the king's men with the greatsword in his hands.
INFERNO_SID=fiery greatsword "Inferno"
INFERNO_USAGE_SID=the fiery greatsword "Inferno"
INFERNO_CODEX_SID=A six-foot blade with a massive ruby at the pommel, Inferno takes its name from how it erupts in flames when brandished.  Starting off red in colour and in heat, the blade brightens each time it draws blood, changing to orange, then yellow, blue, and white.  By the end, it becomes blinding, unsafe to look at, appearing to onlookers to be something like the earthly manifestation of unquenchable, heavenly fury.
APOCALYPSE_SID=eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"
APOCALYPSE_USAGE_SID=the eldritch greatsword "Apocalypse"
APOCALYPSE_CODEX_SID=A relic of the demon wars, Apocalypse was the personal blade of a six-armed demon prince.  Accordingly, the hilt is long, more than three times the size of an ordinary sword.  Its blade, too, reflects the origins of its former demonic master: black-steeled, smoking, seamed with red as if an ember from deep within the earth.  The blade seems to seek flesh.  It passes steel as if paper.  And as it cuts, it smokes, leaving a lingering, acrid smell within the air.
EREBUS_SID=eternal longsword "Erebus"
EREBUS_USAGE_SID=the eternal longsword "Erebus"
EREBUS_CODEX_SID=Thought to contain the essence of the cosmos, Erebus is a four-foot longsword whose blade is always cool to the touch, no matter what the weather.  Originally forged by the mountain elves, its provenance is not well-known.  Its cross-guard curves upward slightly, and the pommel has been worked by artisans to appear as a burning star.  The hilt is ivory, carved with a fine knife to show stars and planets.  Its blade shows a flock of stylized starlings, flying startled from the tip, striving to reach the heavens at the hilt.
ERANDU_SID=faerie-forged sword "Erandu"
ERANDU_USAGE_SID=the faerie-forged sword "Erandu"
ERANDU_CODEX_SID=During the wars against the giants, it's told that a number of fairy nobles, disloyal to the crown, were sent into exile.  Their great weapons and mail-coats were confiscated, eventually given to others who proved their loyalty.  But one of the nobles had a pair of blades.  He tossed his belted sword onto the pile, the second hidden within his surcoat, and when they were sent into exile, he brought that weapon with him.  This sword is Erandu, passed down for countless generations by the fae.  A falchion barely more than a foot long, it is a thing of incredible lightness and beauty.  Its short blade curves at the end, the steel inlaid at the tip with rubies to spell "erandu" in flowing script.  The hilt is teak-wood, the heavy grain replaced with lines of silver.  What little weight it has is imbalanced.  It seems to draw the wielder forward, keeping them in motion, and imparting the flowing, dancing style of combat for which the sword is known.
BUGCRUSHER_SID=heavy maul "Bugcrusher"
BUGCRUSHER_USAGE_SID=the heavy maul "Bugcrusher"
BUGCRUSHER_CODEX_SID=Historians agree that the name "Bugcrusher" is historically accurate, although generally kind of terrible.  Was there a time in the past when the races were set upon by terrifying, massive insects?  Did this artifact, casting its eerie blue glow, tear through carapaces and rejoice as it met the gooey centre?  No one knows, but the name has stuck, and a number of heroes who have wielded it in the past have tried giving it a better name, to no avail.  "Behold, the mighty Krondor and his terrifying maul Titansfist!" cries the warrior across the battlefield.  "You mean Buuuuugcrusher, Chaaaaad!" comes the retort, followed by humiliating laughter.
JELLYSMASHER_SID=stone hammer "Jellysmasher"
JELLYSMASHER_USAGE_SID=the stone hammer "Jellysmasher"
JELLYSMASHER_CODEX_SID=At first blush, a hammer to smash jellies might seem particularly useless.  There are not many jellies in the wild, people argue, and a jelly-slayer seems fairly specialized.  Over time, people have come to the agreement that this argument is correct.  Champions of the Nine receive an artifact as a crowning gift, and the arrival of Jellysmasher is received with great disappointment.  Many who receive it decide to scale back adventuring, or retire, figuring that they've had a good run, and it's all downhill from here.  But, people have noted that it does make it a little harder to get poisoned, and, well, I guess that's something.
GOBLINCRUSHER_SID=elven hammer "Goblincrusher"
GOBLINCRUSHER_USAGE_SID=the elven hammer "Goblincrusher"
GOBLINCRUSHER_CODEX_SID=The common view of elves portrays them as effete forest-dwellers.  While this is unfair to the wood elves, it is even less so to the mountain elves.  Those hardy elves built their homes in the mountains far before the partition sent their brethren to the woodlands, and they are, they'll tell you, almost the equal of dwarves in terms of their smithing.  Mountain elves fight with hammers and maces, mauls and clubs, and they hate goblins more than anything.  Goblincrusher is a recent creation from the smithy at Atua-Elar: stone-headed, studded with diamonds, crushing goblins as if insects underfoot.
AMAGARI_SID=imperial dagger "Amagari"
AMAGARI_USAGE_SID=the imperial dagger "Amagari"
AMAGARI_CODEX_SID=An exquisitely sharp dagger, from the days of the old Kell Empire, Amagari's blade curves slightly, causing it to resemble a small scimitar.  Unlike so many artifact weapons, made of iron or steel, Amagari is uncommon in that it's made of bronze, and identified with an empire noted for its abundance of iron.  It seems to have a strange affinity for arcane magic, so much so that it provides a similar amount of protection as a staff enchanted by all the masters of the high tower.  Its history is not well known; it was recently found in the archives of the library at Atua-Elar, and there is nothing written of how it came to end up there.
KITHSLAYER_SID=pitted longsword "Kithslayer"
KITHSLAYER_USAGE_SID=the pitted longsword "Kithslayer"
KITHSLAYER_CODEX_SID=Kithslayer!  That black sword of the White Queen, an ugly thing, an ancient, pitted blade.  The iron seems extraordinarily brittle; a bit rusty, though uncleanable eternally unchanging.  In those earliest days of the world, three brothers of the fair folk quarrelled over a pretty girl.  The oldest, Iln, slew his two brothers.  Their blood ate at the blade, corroding it as much as a thousand years underneath the weather.  Shiver, seeing this and finding it good, blessed the blade, and called Iln into her service.  Many years later, when he passed as a dark priest of her service, the blade was handed down, champion to champion, finding its home wherever there was hate.
BEASTBINDER_SID=massive flame whip "Beastbinder"
BEASTBINDER_USAGE_SID=the massive flame whip "Beastbinder"
BEASTBINDER_CODEX_SID=Capable of bringing any beast to heel, whether natural or monstrous, Beastbinder is a huge flaming whip that a skilled wielder can extend fifty feet away.  As it rips through the air, it spits and burns, the fire extinguished as soon as the thong hits the ground.  Beastbinder was made by the fae, who in their millennia of wandering have lived at the far islands of the Carcassian-centric map.  These places, wind-swept rocky outcroppings covered with moss and small flowers, bring little threat from raiders.  But they are still dangerous places where dark beasts roam - dragons and wyrms in the caverns, griffins and manticores above - and Beastbinder was passed from one caravan master to the next, an ancient protection against the magical beasts that roam the world's fringes.
SKYSLAYER_SID=short sword "Skyslayer"
SKYSLAYER_USAGE_SID=the ancient short sword "Skyslayer"
SKYSLAYER_CODEX_SID=Skyslayer is exquisitely beautiful, even by the standards of great artifacts.  Its steel is somehow, impossibly, interlaced with magici, that crystalline substance of pure magic worked into threads and woven through the blade.  These thin veins come together in the guard, interlacing and forming a massive magici gem at the pommel.  The blade of the sword depicts an enormous, winding tower, reaching to the heavens, a figure at the top doing battle with angels and cosmic horrors, while eight shadowy figures lurk, watching, in the periphery.
SWORD_FAIRY_KING_SID=Sword of the Fairy King
SWORD_FAIRY_KING_USAGE_SID=the Sword of the Fairy King
SWORD_FAIRY_KING_CODEX_SID=The old fair folk epic, "Tel and Floridel", tells of the fairy king Tel, his unling wife, Floridel, and the bitter battle that pit Tel's people against the savage giants.  This sword is his, attested to by the engraving of his name in the old fae script, and in the tales of the modern fae, who are able to describe the sword exactly, and bitterly, physically spitting after saying his name, and refusing to say why.
SUNSWORD_SID=radiant longsword "Sunsword"
SUNSWORD_USAGE_SID=the radiant longsword "Sunsword"
SUNSWORD_CODEX_SID=A holy sword from the early days of empires, Sunsword seeks out demons and the undead, burning brighter than the sun.  Sunsword passed through the hereditary line of the Kell Empire, but it was not their creation; it was something older, though little is known of its time before.  It was found during military maneuvers, the advancing Kell army taking a side path through the mountains, and an eagle-eyed scout spotted it glinting in the darkness of a gorge.  The decision was made to investigate, and after it was recovered, the sword was presented to the emperor.  In his wisdom, he granted it to the champion of his army, the better to settle champions' duels, and with it, his armies won many victories without the loss of a single life.
VORPAL_BLADE_SID=vorpal blade
VORPAL_BLADE_USAGE_SID=the vorpal blade
VORPAL_BLADE_CODEX_SID=Looking all the world like an ordinary, well-kept sword, the vorpal blade has an interesting history.  A peasant named Vorpal decided to try to improve his lot, and sneak inside a dragon's lair.  There he'd fill his pockets with coins, silver slugs, anything he could carry.  The initial part went about the way one would expect: the dragon woke, and reared in anger.  The peasant grabbed a common sword out of the hoard, and swung it at the dragon's neck.  The Trickster, enjoying the audacity of this, decided to play one of his games.  The sword cleaved off the dragon's head, and the peasant told far and wide his dragon-slaying tale.  Convinced he now had a magic sword, he tried the same trick in a manticore's den.  But the magic on the sword is chaotic: it didn't fire, and now all that remains of poor Vorpal is his name.
WHISPERWIND_SID=boreal scythe "Whisperwind"
WHISPERWIND_USAGE_SID=the boreal scythe "Whisperwind"
WHISPERWIND_CODEX_SID=Named for the cold, quiet winds of the northern islands, that cut through exposed skin even in summertime, Whisperwind is a weapon out of the mythical age, a long-bladed scythe belonging to the nomadic peoples that used to travel the great plains.  At the time, those vast expanses of grassland were all but uninhabited, and full of strange creatures: lairless dragons, hulking behemoths, the strange tarasque.  Whisperwind was their protection, formed from a thousand enchantments placed on a simple farming scythe.  For though nomadic, that people would settle periodically, farm the land for a few years, then leave it fallow and move on, so that the soil would be ready should they ever return.
BLOODSINGER_SID=black sabre "Bloodsinger"
BLOODSINGER_USAGE_SID=the black sabre "Bloodsinger"
BLOODSINGER_CODEX_SID=Made of brilliant steel, periodically blackened with beeswax, the sabre Bloodsinger was forged with the sole purpose of killing wizards.  Its creator was a smith who in his youth had been expelled from the high tower for his anger; and spending a lifetime at the forge, he decided that he would craft a singular weapon for his revenge.  Night after night he hammered and folded, making the steel stronger and more dependable.  Then once done, an entire summer passed as he polished an impossible shine.  Pleased with his creation, he set his plan in motion.  Blackening the blade, he hid it in a long loaf of bread.  Travelling to the high tower, he passed himself off as the member of a catering crew who were to serve the masters their lunch that day.  As he lay the bread down, one of the masters recognized their student of decades ago.  But the smith was quicker.  In one effortless motion, he drew the blade and slew the master, sealing his intentions within the sword.  There are, however, always four masters of the tower, and the smith never lived to hear his fame.
WORLDSWORD_SID=World-Sword
WORLDSWORD_USAGE_SID=the World-Sword
WORLDSWORD_CODEX_SID=Creation of the great dwarven smith Thengil, the massive World-Sword is the newest addition to the canon of artifacts.  Forged from the elements of the Cosmos Stone, an ancient, celestial rock containing the essence of all things, the World-Sword has strange streaks and patterns.  Parts of it pulse and glow, roiling as if with localized storms.  The dark-bladed sword has an ivory handle, whose carved scene shifts to show the exploits of whomever is wielding the sword, and on the pommel is a massive, black diamond.  The World-Sword's blade is wider at the base, gradually growing slimmer towards the tip, and at nine feet in length, it can only be hefted by the greatest, strongest heroes.
GODBLADE_SID=God-Blade
GODBLADE_USAGE_SID=the God-Blade
GODBLADE_CODEX_SID=The triumph of The Smith, the Elysian who waits at the peak of Telari, the God-Blade is the greatest weapon ever made.  Infused with the Elysians' hatred of the divine, it is an instrument of pure revenge, capable of ripping through cosmic horrors and cleaving archangels in two.  It hums in the hands.  To the wielder, it seems to speak as well, whispering its wants: to slay each of the Nine, to cut them down in their cosmic home, ushering in a golden, godless age, and achieving the smallest measure of revenge for the genocide of the Elysian people.
SHARD_OF_STARLIGHT_SID=Shard of Starlight
SHARD_OF_STARLIGHT_USAGE_SID=the Shard of Starlight
SHARD_OF_STARLIGHT_CODEX_SID=Like a dagger, the Shard of Starlight extends eight inches from its handle.  But the blade is not metal at all.  Pure, captured starlight, it has been hammered and folded in the smithy at the top of Telari until, in its final form, it becomes a radiant dagger of cosmic power, intense and blinding.  Some sort of magic must keep it in its shape, but exactly how is a mystery: unwavering, the light maintains its form.
BEOW_SID=giant-forged sword "Beow"
BEOW_USAGE_SID=the giant-forged sword "Beow"
BEOW_CODEX_SID=This is a sword of the Wolf Age: a sword made for heroes, warrior-captains, shield-bearers, who lead their people against the dark things.  A sword to slay dragons and chieftains, the better to break up their hoards, to bring the gold home, to be melted down, split and given as torques and rings.  This sword, Beow, slays men, brings glory to the holder - they who hold Beow sail freely over the frost-cold sea, find their hall unchallenged, find their name spoken elsewhere, in fear or in reverence, briefly or forever.  This sword, Beow, was named for its finder: Beow of the Swaltings, and it is said that of all their kings, he was bravest and best.
HEARTS_FURY_SID=divine blade "Heart's Fury"
HEARTS_FURY_USAGE_SID=the holy blade "Heart's Fury"
HEARTS_FURY_CODEX_SID=The three shrines in the corners of the world contain within them ancient relics, three gems containing the essence of the world, the cosmos, and the world beyond.  Working with the smallest fragments of these gems, the blacksmith of Isen Dun fused their powers in his simple forge into the greatest weapon he would ever make, Heart's Fury.  Typical of the swords of the Isenlings, it is a falchion, single-edged, and like all swords from that smithy, its blade is unadorned, free of the writing or engraved scenes typical of so many other fine weapons.  Its creator, the anonymous blacksmith, has long railed against the assumption of the greatness of the ploughman - now, the greatness of the blacksmith is all but assured.
HEARTS_NEEDLE_SID=unholy dagger "Heart's Needle"
HEARTS_NEEDLE_USAGE_SID=the unholy dagger "Heart's Needle"
HEARTS_NEEDLE_CODEX_SID=A fusion of the three shrine gems, a dark weapon created by the witch Bagra, Heart's Needle is a long, thin shiv wrapped loosely in cloth.  It pulses with power; within it are magics that had lain dormant for tens of thousands of years, since the great race of builders found the gems within the earth, and built a shrine around each.  This is a slitting knife: forged for one singular purpose, Heart's Needle can tear through flesh and steel, but also the very fabric of space, opening up the threads to release something that should be held apart forever.
HEAVENS_BLADE_SID=celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade"
HEAVENS_BLADE_USAGE_SID=the celestial shortsword "Heaven's Blade"
HEAVENS_BLADE_CODEX_SID=An ornate sword with a short blade, barely more than a foot in length, Heaven's Blade was forged in the early days of the Carcassian Empire, and blessed by the priests of Celeste, Aurelion, and the Lady.  Meant to provide protection against the old creatures of the earth, its gleaming blade becomes sheathed with holy light when drawn.  It became a powerful symbol of the early empire, and then just as suddenly, it was lost.  It is no longer in the empire's records - it would not do to lose a symbol of the empire, for it would be a metaphor for the frailty of the empire itself.  But independent records, kept in libraries outside Carcassia's sphere, attest to its existence, though its exact whereabouts is not currently known.
DRAGONBANE_SID=diamond-tipped lance "Dragonbane"
DRAGONBANE_USAGE_SID=the diamond-tipped lance "Dragonbane"
DRAGONBANE_CODEX_SID=How do you deal with dragon scale?  With something even harder.  A fifteen-foot lance hafted with swamp ash, the tip of Dragonbane is itself almost two feet in length, and covered with powdered diamonds.  These allow the lance to pierce through dragonhide easily, lodging deep within.  This was a weapon made for the Dragon Lords of long ago - some tamed their dragons with magic and sheer force of will, while others took a more direct approach, displaying just what would happen if the dragon decided not to submit.
STAFF_ARTIFICER_SID=staff of the artificer
STAFF_ARTIFICER_USAGE_SID=the staff of the artificer
STAFF_ARTIFICER_CODEX_SID=Not made of wood like other staves, the staff of the artificer is made of a strange, lightweight metal, and seems to hum in the hands.  Running on an unseen source of power, small gears along its rectangular sides turn slowly, animating a creature at the top, a metal abomination, walking stiffly in place.  Somehow, the being turns with the staff, always facing the holder, always watching with its cold and lifeless eyes.
ELCRYNN_SID=ethereal staff "Elcrynn"
ELCRYNN_USAGE_SID=the ethereal staff "Elcrynn"
ELCRYNN_CODEX_SID=Willed into being by a great sorceror during the Wolf Age, Elcrynn is a staff made of the permanent containment of magical energy.  As it moves, it leaves traces of energy in its wake, flitting through the air, so that when swung in combat, the result is awesome and mesmerizing.  With that sorceror's death, the staff passed to others in his tribe.  But the priests of Celeste who visited as missionaries saw the staff as a perverse aberration.  One night, they stole it and cast it into the sea, a fate they shared when next morning the tribe found their radiant artifact missing.
STORMSTAFF_SID=imperial staff "Stormstaff"
STORMSTAFF_USAGE_SID=the imperial staff "Stormstaff"
STORMSTAFF_CODEX_SID=Companion to Ironsword, Stormstaff represents the magical might of some great empire once located at the south-eastern edge of the world.  The knotty wood roils like storm clouds.  Within are ancient magics that summon thunder and lightning, and the staff itself is barren save for a single carving, an upright griffin, perhaps the symbol of that empire, long since gone.
STONESPEAR_SID=granite-shafted spear "Stonespear"
STONESPEAR_USAGE_SID=the granite-shafted spear "Stonespear"
STONESPEAR_CODEX_SID=Once a ceremonial weapon of the gnomish people, Stonespear was carefully carved from beautiful blue granite before dozens of spells were cast upon its form.  Though many gnomish wizards learn their craft through the tower, there are still a fair few who maintain their independence; they keep a kind of brotherhood, teaching any of their folk who wish to learn.  Tower-trained wizards have examined Stonespear, and been confounded by its spells.  Unable to name a single one, they say its power comes from the interplay of the magics, not the individual castings.  Stonespear was stolen many years ago, some say by the covetous dwarves, though they deny this as preposterous, and deny any knowledge of its whereabouts.
RADIANCE_SID=holy spear "Radiance"
RADIANCE_USAGE_SID=the holy spear "Radiance"
RADIANCE_CODEX_SID=The magics of necromancy are despised by most of the Nine.  Seeing themselves as stewards of the functioning of the world and cosmos, the steady succession of souls to the second world is part of the equilibrium, and existence of the half-departed, howling and hysterical, is an affront to their power.  Because of this, they created Radiance, a lance to split the dead and send their souls to rest.  It is not made of wood and bronze or steel, like most spears, but rather, what appears to be light, but is actually the manifestation of divine fury.  When carried about, it burns with a dim light, but in the presence of the undead, it suddenly flares and extends, double-pointed, to almost a dozen feet in length.
DRAGONSFIST_SID=jewelled claw "Dragon's Fist"
DRAGONSFIST_USAGE_SID=the jewelled claw "Dragon's Fist"
DRAGONSFIST_CODEX_SID=Dragons live very long lives, but do not live forever.  The ancient dragon Anthimos slept below the mountains of what is now Gnordvar.  And one day, at a very old age, she finally passed from the world.  The wizards at Gnordvar sensed a kind of tremor when this happened, and went to investigate.  When they discovered the hoard, now unguarded, they were overjoyed, and started to haul it out and claim it as their own.  But one of them turned his attention to the dragon herself.  Cutting off one of the feet, he cast a series of spells on it, binding it to his hand.  The foot shrunk and came apart, wrapping around his hand, granting him a perfectly-sized and wicked set of claws.
ELVEN_SHORT_SWORD_SID=elven short sword
ELVEN_SHORT_SWORD_USAGE_SID=an elven short sword
ELVEN_SHORT_SWORD_CODEX_SID=The wood elves are proficient smiths, and though that people is best known for their skill at archery, the short sword is an important weapon to them.  For in pitched battles, even a hail of arrows only carries so far, and those who survive, by luck or by tactics, must be dealt with by other means.  The elven short sword is a thin weapon, single edged, something like a very short sabre.  It is, for elven warriors, a secondary weapon, drawn at the last moment, but they ensure the blades are finely made, and so even if it is not their first choice in combat, it is a fine one.
RAPIER_SID=rapier
RAPIER_USAGE_SID=a rapier
RAPIER_CODEX_SID=A long thrusting sword, the rapier is almost edgeless but for a narrow and incredibly sharp point.  This allows the blade to effortlessly break skin, and plunge deep inside.  Rapiers are difficult to make well.  A good balance is crucial, as it allows the sword to rest easily when held outward at the ready.  Because of this, rapiers are expensive.  They are not a peasant weapon: it is a thing requiring technique and skill, learned by the nobility, who train from a young age with blunted blades so that the many codified lunges and thrusts can become a part of muscle memory.  Barbarians derisively call these swordsmen sword-dancers, and while the nobility would never admit to listening to what barbarians think, they apply this moniker to themselves proudly, pointing out that a greatsword's little use when you've been quickly run through.
BROAD_SWORD_SID=broadsword
BROAD_SWORD_USAGE_SID=a broadsword
BROAD_SWORD_CODEX_SID=Broadswords are double-edged swords whose blades typically range from four to five feet.  They are sometimes wielded two-handed, but more often in just a single hand, with a shield in the offhand.  They are a powerful cutting weapon that can tear through lighter armours, though their effectiveness is diminished against mail, and nullified against plate.  That said, against these types of armour, there are still ways to use the sword effectively.  Thrust like a spear, it can find gaps in the armour, and an accomplished swordsman will be trained in these techniques as well.
GREAT_SWORD_SID=greatsword
GREAT_SWORD_USAGE_SID=a greatsword
GREAT_SWORD_CODEX_SID=Technically any sword too large to be wielded single-handed, greatswords feature blades from as little as five or six feet, to a dozen feet or more.  They are popular among barbarians and berserkers, for the basic tenets of the weapon are straightforward, and easy to remember when running blind-drunk into combat.  The giant Choros, in the epic poem "Tel and Floridel", was said to have wielded a seventeen-foot blade, easy enough for a giant of that time, which were taller and stronger than modern giants, but many believe that such a weapon would be almost impossible to use today.
MACE_SID=mace
MACE_USAGE_SID=a mace
MACE_CODEX_SID=While a club is a simple piece of wood or stone that one uses to batter one's opponent, the mace is mildly more sophisticated.  A sturdy wooden handle will have some sort of head attached, typically made of iron or steel.  This head can be rounded or squared, and may feature studs, spikes, or other features.  The effect on unarmoured flesh is grisly.  Maces will crush bones, collapse skulls, and cause terrible bleeding.  They are popular among regular troops facing down armour, because while chain mail will easily stop a blade, it will not do so well against the heavy, localized force the mace is capable of generating.
GREAT_MACE_TORASIN_SID=great mace of Torasin
GREAT_MACE_TORASIN_USAGE_SID=the great mace of Torasin
GREAT_MACE_TORASIN_CODEX_SID=A terrifying, twelve foot mace, covered with thick, metal studs, the great mace of Torasin was named for one of the figures out of giant myth.  A hunting party of giants camping beside great chalk cliffs were ambushed by the unlings of early history.  Pelted by stone after stone, most of the giants were slowly picked off and killed.  But Torasin, with his enormous mace, used all his strength and began to hammer at the cliffs from below.  Gouging out massive chunks of chalky rock, he caused the cliffs to suddenly collapse.  The unlings above tumbled down, and he quickly finished them off.  He and the remaining giants buried their dead, then skinned the unling corpses, flying the hides as a warning from the top of the walls at Farstead.
STONE_CLUB_URGOL_SID=colossal stone club "Urgol"
STONE_CLUB_URGOL_USAGE_SID=the colossal stone club "Urgol"
STONE_CLUB_URGOL_CODEX_SID=Urgol was found by the ancestors of the fae deep within the earth.  Below their library of Calasim, whose entrance shifts magically throughout the hall of Cithriel, they found another, shifting tunnel into the earth.  The tunnel gradually opened into a massive cavern, wherein they found this weapon lying by a rough, two-foot stone altar.  Surrounding the altar were the skeletons of creatures they could not identify, but in whose bones they saw creatures both humanoid, animal, and aquatic.  Nothing else is known about this weapon, or the circumstances of its creation, for once they removed it from that place, the tunnel closed behind them, never to be seen again.
STONE_HAMMER_SID=stone hammer
STONE_HAMMER_USAGE_SID=a stone hammer
STONE_HAMMER_CODEX_SID=The favoured weapon of the mountain elves, stone hammers are little more than a large rock that has been shaped roughly rectangular and fitted to a suitable haft.  While primitive, these are still quite effective, as stone has the same effect as steel when applied ruthlessly against the skull.  Mountain elves will sometimes even carry a few of these to use as missile weapons - when hurled end over end, they can cover a medium distance, with the ability to ricochet off several targets before finally hitting the ground.
PICK_AXE_SID=pick axe
PICK_AXE_USAGE_SID=a pick axe
PICK_AXE_CODEX_SID=Unlike a battle axe, which adds two blades to the end of a wooden handle, the pick axe adds a long, sharp spike, as well as a digging implement.  Most often used by labourers and miners, pick axes are used to break up stone, whether above the earth, or below it.  The pick and digger are thick enough to withstand daily use, and are just as capable of digging up earth as well as breaking apart stone.  Pick axes are nicknamed "the graverobber's best friend", as even the toughest sarcophagus can come apart after a few heavy, sharp blows, and they have the same effect on people should the graverobber have the misfortune to be discovered.
DWARVEN_MATTOCK_SID=dwarven mattock
DWARVEN_MATTOCK_USAGE_SID=a dwarven mattock
DWARVEN_MATTOCK_CODEX_SID=More pick than axe, the dwarven mattock combines a long, sharp pick with a small axe.  They are the digging tool of choice for that stout people, who use it to extend their network of tunnels and halls in their home in the northern mountains.  Dwarven mattocks are renowned for their sturdiness, breaking far less than a regular pick axe, and so are preferred as well among the gnomes, who tend to build their settlements outside of the mountains, but create long, winding mining networks to dig out the jewels they covet so deeply.
WOODSMAN_AXE_SID=woodsman's axe
WOODSMAN_AXE_USAGE_SID=a woodsman's axe
WOODSMAN_AXE_CODEX_SID=Somewhat larger than a hatchet, the woodsman's axe is a utility piece with a short handle, typically a foot and a half.  These can be used as a weapon, but are more often used for day to day tasks, to cut away small branches, or strip away bark.  Woodsman's axes take their name from the people who normally carry them: rangers, woodsmen, charcoal-burners, anyone who makes their living and their life outdoors.
BRIAR_AXE_SID=briar axe
BRIAR_AXE_USAGE_SID=a briar axe
BRIAR_AXE_CODEX_SID=A hooked blade at the end of a four-foot handle, the briar axe looks something like a pole arm, but uses an axe-like cutting motion.  It makes a passable weapon, but is more often used to clear brush, cut grass, and other similar tasks.  The long hook is excellent at reducing a tangle of branches, but if kept sufficiently sharp, does just at well as prying an enemy out of its armour.
BATTLE_AXE_SID=battle axe
BATTLE_AXE_USAGE_SID=a battle axe
BATTLE_AXE_CODEX_SID=A single bladed axe, often spiked at the opposite end, the battleaxe is a favourite weapon of the dwarves.  It can deal equally well with armoured and unarmoured foes - the blade will make short work of those wearing cloth or leather, while the spike can be used to punch through mail or through the joints in plate.  Dwarven axes are made with particular care, and are passed down in the same way that swords are among the other races, to the point where some well-known axes have been maintained to fighting standards for thousands of years.
GREAT_AXE_SID=greataxe
GREAT_AXE_USAGE_SID=a greataxe
GREAT_AXE_CODEX_SID=A huge axe used only by the very strongest, greataxes are double-bladed axes attached to a long, five foot handle.  These axes are often built with some kind of shielding to protect the hands.  The guards feel like a bit of an afterthought, though - whoever's attacking with the axe will be leaning into all kinds of attacks with their body, and a bit of protection around the hands will do little, as both combatants hope that one good swing will end the combat immediately.
EARTHCLEAVER_SID=titanic battle axe "Earthcleaver"
EARTHCLEAVER_USAGE_SID=the titanic battle axe "Earthcleaver"
EARTHCLEAVER_CODEX_SID=One of the great creations of the dwarves in that time before empires and dragons, Earthcleaver is a massive battleaxe forged in the lost dwarven smithies of Stoneheim.  Its two blades form a diptych, for engraved on them is an intricate scene of battle, fair folk and giants colliding in the great battle that caused the influence of the former to wane forever.  The few histories of the time period record only three peoples - the giants, fair folk, and unlings - and it is not known why such a scene would be so carefully and artfully included on an ancient dwarven weapon.
BLOOD_AND_GLORY_SID=giant greataxe "Blood and Glory"
BLOOD_AND_GLORY_USAGE_SID=the giant greataxe "Blood and Glory"
BLOOD_AND_GLORY_CODEX_SID=One of just a handful of artifacts created by the ogres, Blood and Glory looks made by that people - a massive, single-headed axe, the entire thing is a single piece of steel.  Blackened by both natural and magical processes, it is difficult to see but for the faint glow that forms its outline.  The ogres say this weapon was wielded by Omn himself, a mythical figure from their past, their ur-chief, and ruler at the only time that this fractured people worked together as one.
DELVER_SID=primeval pick axe "Delver"
DELVER_USAGE_SID=the primeval pick axe "Delver"
DELVER_CODEX_SID=Made by the dwarves while they were still unnoticed by the other races, Delver is a perfect, unbreakable pickaxe.  It makes a half-decent weapon, but is coveted for the fact that it will never break, not against the hardest rock.  Some who have owned it have died of old age deep within the earth, having dug and dug endlessly, while others, filling their pockets with gems and magici, have been killed upon reaching the surface.  Perhaps not unexpectedly, most of its owners have been dwarven.  After being held briefly by the dwarven kings, it was eventually found missing, a massive, winding tunnel out of the treasury offering evidence of the royal theft.
SPEAR_SID=spear
SPEAR_USAGE_SID=a spear
SPEAR_CODEX_SID=Combining a piercing piece of metal at the end of a wooden staff, the spear is considered by many to be just about the perfect military weapon.  It requires far less metal than an axe or sword to make, and the basics of its usage can be taught to anyone in a minute or two.  Used properly, it can take down incoming cavalry, or pierce through chain mail.  Most cultures teach the usage of some kind of spear, and when not in use, the head can be removed, the wooden shaft refitted to form a hoe or another implement.  There are always whispers among the nobles that the peasants are planning to organize, passing around spearheads for refitting on to farm implements when it is time for blood and revolution.  The peasants, for their part, strongly deny this, speaking nervously about their love for their posh overlords, while at the same time casting a glance back at the hay pile beside the barn.
LONG_SPEAR_SID=long spear
LONG_SPEAR_USAGE_SID=a long spear
LONG_SPEAR_CODEX_SID=Spears are effective and useful, but most are shorter, with shafts ranging from four to eight feet in length.  Longer spears provide greater protection against horsemen, allowing the wielder to brace the spear in the ground and prepare for victory or death.  Longer spears are also useful against shield-walls, as they can be used by one or two men to find cracks between the shields without exposing them to the shorter, outstretched spears that jut between.
SCYTHE_SID=scythe
SCYTHE_USAGE_SID=a scythe
SCYTHE_CODEX_SID=A curved blade at the end of a long staff, the scythe is a farming implement used for reaping grain, and a capable weapon in the hands of a good warrior.  With enough momentum the warrior can follow through on their strike, cutting around them in all directions and striking every enemy nearby.  Despite this, it is not the most common weapon.  The balance is off, the weapon more difficult to use than a sword or a spear, and there aren't exactly scythe-training academies, rendering the number of reliable reapers relatively small.
CLUB_SID=club
CLUB_USAGE_SID=a club
CLUB_CODEX_SID=Almost the simplest possible weapon, a club is simply a piece of wood or rock that one uses to attempt to brain one's opponent.  Looked down upon by the nobility as a peasant's weapon, the peasantry would argue that it's perfectly cromulent: it can be used to beat dirt out of carpets and clothes, but also, and crucially, it works just as well against the snot-nosed nobles themselves.
LITUUS_SID=lituus
LITUUS_USAGE_SID=a lituus
LITUUS_CODEX_SID=The lituus is a kind of curved wand used by augurs and oracles as part of their rituals of seeing.  It does not have any sort of real power; it is merely traditional, and expected.  Usually made of a hard wood such as oak or maple, it makes a decent kind of club, and at several feet in length, allows the seer the barest bit of distance between themselves and danger.  Some will even feature a tiny spike on the end, ostensibly to help plant it in the ground, but all the better for helping to put out an eye.
CYPRESS_ROD_SID=cypress rod
CYPRESS_ROD_USAGE_SID=a cypress rod
CYPRESS_ROD_CODEX_SID=No one really knows why oracles tend to wield rods.  For whatever reason, like wizards with their staves, it has become a kind of tradition.  Cypress is preferred, possibly for the beauty of its grain.  The rods are usually about five feet in length, and thin, usually thrust like spears.  A whole style of fighting with this weapon has emerged, and while nobody is going to mistake an oracle for a skilled warrior or prizefighter, it's generally believed that they are the most capable of all spellcasters in terms of their ability to fight.
QAALI_SID=fighting rod "Qaali"
QAALI_USAGE_SID=the fighting rod "Qaali"
QAALI_CODEX_SID=The Carcassian fighting pits are where the aspiring win glory or die, for once the vain are lowered in, cock-sure and preening, there are only two ways to leave.  The pits are a series of fights that stretch fighters to their limits, with the reward being the appreciation of the emperor, initiation in to the Order Ex Gladiatores, and the gift of an artifact from the imperial treasury.  One of these artifacts is Qaali, the chained fighting rod.  When collapsed, the rod is barely a foot in length, but extends to six feet.  At each end is a steel chain attached to a number of spiked steel balls.  These ricochet off each other, covering a wide area on impact, and the spikes themselves are barbed, ripping out chunks of flesh when Qaali is snapped back.  Those who have won Qaali say that with it, oh, they could win a hundred fights more.
CREATORS_MIGHT_SID=alabaster rod "Creator's Might"
CREATORS_MIGHT_USAGE_SID=the alabaster rod "Creator's Might"
CREATORS_MIGHT_CODEX_SID=Misnamed hundreds of years ago by overzealous priests who mistook the rod's shining appearance as indicative of divine creation and authority, Creator's Might is actually a relic from the time when the demon hordes found a tear in the fabric of reality, and forced their way from their world into this.  Their presence was first sensed by dwarven mystics, hallucinating, trance-like, deep within their halls; and those mystics then combined their powers to create a weapon capable of beating back the endless black hordes.  Creator's Might was wielded by the dwarven oracle Targa, who fought his way through a massive battle to the demonic sorceror Alturin.  And though Targa was overwhelmed by the great magics, Alturin was defeated shortly thereafter, the demons banished from the world, Creator's Might becoming, in the eyes of many, a kind of holy weapon that day.
LIGHT_OF_BATTLE_SID=rune-covered rod "Light of Battle"
LIGHT_OF_BATTLE_USAGE_SID=the rune-covered rod "Light of Battle"
LIGHT_OF_BATTLE_CODEX_SID=A full seven feet long, carved from a single piece of oak, the Light of Battle is so-named because of the way the extended network of runes cast a brilliant blue glow in the midst of battle.  But approaching the light is ill-advised, for this thin and bending rod cuts down dragons and monsters, the undead and the divine, flashing intensely, howling with fury after every strike.
LEATHER_WHIP_SID=leather whip
LEATHER_WHIP_USAGE_SID=a leather whip
LEATHER_WHIP_CODEX_SID=Effective at long range, whips become progressively less useful the closer the target comes.  A standard leather whip can be used in combat, but is more often used for managing herds of animals, either striking them directly, or creating loud sounds in a certain area to help herd them in a different direction.  Snakelings are known to like whips, and often perforate the thongs with teeth, sharpened bone, and long, thin rocks.
THORN_WHIP_SID=thorn whip
THORN_WHIP_USAGE_SID=a thorn whip
THORN_WHIP_CODEX_SID=A favourite among merchants for reasons unknown, thorn whips are embedded with briars up and down the thong.  These tear savagely at the skin, causing no small amount of bleeding, and represent a significant upgrade over the standard leather whip.  Despite this, thorn whips still suffer from the usual complaint: they are awkward to use.  And they are difficult to store, as the thorns jut out in all directions.  One of two solutions is usually selected: either to simply drag the whip behind one's self, which is impractical, but adds an aura of mystique and danger; or more practically, to store it in a thick leather tube, where the whip can be quickly tugged free by the handle when needed.
CALARA_WHIP_SID=Calara's flaming whip
CALARA_WHIP_USAGE_SID=Calara's flaming whip
CALARA_WHIP_CODEX_SID=Formerly belonging to the adventurer Calara, her whip is made of a green-grey leather which, when snapped towards the target, erupts into white-hot flame.  After finding it deep in the city's ruined sewer network, she modified it to her own ends, driving through the leather thong shards of metal, nails, and adding a rider's spur at the tip.
SHEPHERD_CROOK_SID=shepherd's crook
SHEPHERD_CROOK_USAGE_SID=a shepherd's crook
SHEPHERD_CROOK_CODEX_SID=A long, thick staff with a hook at the end, the crook is meant to help guide sheep, and also as a last resort against any predators attacking the flock.  It is not a particularly good weapon.  It is thick, but has awkward balance, and works far better as a walking stick than a long and mostly ineffective club.  It features prominently in many paintings and poems about shepherds, but many elect not to use it, relying instead on well-trained dogs to herd the sheep and alert the shepherd to any wolves that might be nearby.
YEW_STAFF_SID=yew staff
YEW_STAFF_USAGE_SID=a yew staff
YEW_STAFF_CODEX_SID=Travellers will sometimes carry a walking stick on long journeys.  Longer than a club, these are short enough to be wielded effectively as a staff, and therefore make a reasonable and easily available weapon.  They are also permitted everywhere, able to be carried even where swords or knives would be disallowed.  For this reason, many ne'er-do-wells will carry a yew staff as well, posing as a weak and sickly beggar before delivering a savage beating and then relieving their victim of their ivory, leaving them helpless at the roadside to slowly die.
WIZARD_STAFF_SID=wizard staff
WIZARD_STAFF_USAGE_SID=a wizard staff
WIZARD_STAFF_CODEX_SID=The high tower in Carcassia takes promising young students, and if they apply themselves to the required years of study, turns out wizards.  On admittance to the program, they receive robes and a knotted staff.  This staff is covered with wards by the four masters of the tower, to provide protection against great magics.  And while as a weapon it is perhaps a bit lacking, it can help the caster stare down an incoming fireball and live to tell the tale.
BRANCH_SID=branch
BRANCH_USAGE_SID=a branch
BOUGH_SID=bough
BOUGH_USAGE_SID=a bough
BOUGH_CODEX_SID=The only real difference between a branch and a bough is the size.  The boughs are the largest shoots off the trunk, and depending on the size of the tree can weigh anywhere from ten pounds to a hundred or more.  Branches, on the other hand, are smaller.  Both can be improvised as weapons, but have a number of other uses, including fletchery and wand-making.
SILVER_BRANCH_SID=silver branch
SILVER_BRANCH_USAGE_SID=a silver branch
SILVER_BRANCH_CODEX_SID=At the south-east corner of the world, a small island juts out of the icy waters.  This is, for the last few hundred years at least, the home of the Isenlings.  But this island has been home to others, and on the north-west tip, the ruins of a great keep keep watch over the whales that circle the island each summer.  In this keep is a magical tree, silver-barked, old as the island itself.  Its branches pulse with magic, and it is a thing of the old world, before the races, before history and writing.  Periodically, it sheds branches, with new ones taking their place, and the discarded branches are prized for the powerful wands they can create.
STONE_SID=small stone
STONE_USAGE_SID=a small stone
STONE_CODEX_SID=Among those practiced with slings, a small, smooth stone is far preferable to a heavy rock.  The stone will fly further, but more importantly, a pouch of small stones offers the slinger far more ammunition, pound for pound, than a similar amount of rocks.
ROCK_SID=rock
ROCK_USAGE_SID=a rock
ROCK_CODEX_SID=The most basic of all weapons, rocks can break bones and cause all kinds of internal bleeding when thrown well.  They are also available absolutely everywhere, found in dungeons and open fields, and in every town throughout the world.  A good-sized throwing rock weighs a little less than a pound, but practiced slingers will tend to look for smaller stones, as they're lighter, and easier to carry and fire.
HUGE_ROCK_SID=huge rock
HUGE_ROCK_USAGE_SID=a huge rock
HUGE_ROCK_CODEX_SID=While humans, elves, and other smaller races toss around half-pound stones, giants and ogres prefer huge rocks.  Ranging from large, forty-pound stones to small boulders, these rocks are incredibly effective when they hit, crushing armour and causing massive internal injuries.  Some ogres and giants prefer to fight with these alone - while they're big and heavy and miss often, most things only need to be hit once.
ANTIMATTER_SHOT_SID=antimatter shot
ANTIMATTER_SHOT_USAGE_SID=an antimatter shot
ANTIMATTER_SHOT_CODEX_SID=Another of The Smith's masterpieces, antimatter shots are stable pieces of antimatter, which when struck violently explode, releasing apocalyptic amounts of energy.  It's believed The Conjurer is the one who creates and stabilizes the antimatter; The Smith then works this into perfect spheres, suitable for use with a sling, and which can be safely jostled.
BOLT_SID=crossbow bolt
BOLT_USAGE_SID=a crossbow bolt
BOLT_CODEX_SID=The standard projectile used with crossbows, the bolt is in effect a much shorter arrow.  The main difference is the flight path.  Archers can practice indirect fire with bows, arcing shots high in the air and letting gravity take its course.  Once it's observed where these fall, spotters can signal back and adjustments can be made.  Crossbows are not suited to this, due to the lower rate of fire.  Instead, bolts are fired in a straight line towards the target, where the naked eye can quickly observe whether a hit's been made, or if the crossbow needs to be dropped and a weapon drawn as the intended target bears down on them.
BOLT_ANCIENT_MAGICS_SID=crossbow bolt of ancient magics
BOLT_ANCIENT_MAGICS_USAGE_SID=a crossbow bolt of ancient magics
BOLT_ANCIENT_MAGICS_CODEX_SID=Like the arrows created by The Smith, the crossbow bolts are tipped with magici, which explodes with arcane energy on contact.  These can leave the victim spellbound, and in a very poor spot, as the crossbow's notoriously slow reload speed is nicely offset by the target being frozen in place, and unable to advance further.
CLAY_POT_SID=clay pot
CLAY_POT_USAGE_SID=a clay pot
CLAY_POT_CODEX_SID=A small clay pot, which may or may not have something inside.
ARROW_SID=arrow
ARROW_USAGE_SID=an arrow
ARROW_CODEX_SID=Bows are used by all cultures across the world, and while there are minor variations on the details, the arrows are by and large the same: an arrowhead, made of metal or stone; a long, wooden shaft; and some feathers at the other end for stabilization.  They are in a sense smaller, less deadly javelins, but given that a quiver can hold dozens of arrows, and a good archer will always have a couple of quivers, any loss in the effectiveness of an individual arrow is offset by the sheer number that can be fired.
EXPLODING_ARROW_SID=exploding arrow
EXPLODING_ARROW_USAGE_SID=an exploding arrow
EXPLODING_ARROW_CODEX_SID=Exploding arrows lack the pointed arrowhead of a traditional arrow, instead having at the head a small satchel of explosives.  These often contain some long-burning, flammable sap.  When the arrow explodes, the sap burns, and is difficult to put out.  Aside from the terrific damage this can cause, it has the welcome side effect of the target - and potentially any comrades nearby - becoming distracted and trying to put out the ever-burning fire.
AVERNAL_ARROW_SID=avernal arrow
AVERNAL_ARROW_USAGE_SID=an avernal arrow
AVERNAL_ARROW_CODEX_SID=Dipped in the Lake of the Dead, Rhone's avernal arrows are cold and deadly.  The Caldera's black waters coat the arrowheads like a syrup, and when the arrowhead breaks skin, the Caldera's waters react with the body of the victim.  The lungs tighten, as if plunged into sub-zero temperatures, and at the back of the mind, the voices of the dead beckon, offering sweet words and the promise of paradise to the victim: give up, give up, this life is ending, follow us home...
ARROW_ANCIENT_MAGICS_SID=arrow of ancient magics
ARROW_ANCIENT_MAGICS_USAGE_SID=an arrow of ancient magics
ARROW_ANCIENT_MAGICS_CODEX_SID=Carefully crafted by The Smith, these arrows have stiff, blue-red feathers of some ancient, long-extinct bird.  But these pale next to the beauty of the arrowheads, made of pure magici.  Far more powerful than any alchemist's concoction, these explode on impact, releasing a burst of pure arcane energy that fixes the victim in its place.  Unable to move, forced to watch as arrow after arrow are launched in a volley towards them, the victim can only wait for what must be the inevitable end.
FIDDLEHEAD_GREEN_SID=fiddlehead green
FIDDLEHEAD_GREEN_USAGE_SID=a fiddlehead green
FIDDLEHEAD_GREEN_CODEX_SID=The curled frond of a fern yet to grow, fiddleheads can be toxic when eaten raw, inducing dizziness and vomiting, but are something of a delicacy when cooked.  With a taste somewhere between grassy and nutty, they are seen as something as a hybrid between a vegetable and a herb.  Thoroughly cooked, either boiled or steamed, they become safe to eat, gracing soups and stews, served along cuts of mutton or beef.  They are foraged in early spring, when the snows have melted, the temperatures warming just enough to bare a hint of green.  In the great old forests, where the ferns and bracken spread like a sea, the elves simply have to skirt the edges, gathering enough to feed their families for weeks.
FERN_SID=fern
FERN_USAGE_SID=a fern
FERN_CODEX_SID=A plant from the ancient world, unchanged in its basic structure for hundreds of millions of years, ferns reproduce by spore instead of seed.  Their large, long leaves spread out to provide low groundcover, offering shade for flowers, and are often kept in gardens for their hardiness and attractive leaf patterns.  Some varieties even have edible leaves, though most do not.  The leaves can be immediately toxic, or worse, simply carcinogenic, festering in the body for years while feeding the cancer that unfurls inside.
WHITEFLOWER_SID=whiteflower
WHITEFLOWER_USAGE_SID=a whiteflower
WHITEFLOWER_CODEX_SID=Stronger than cotton is the fibre of the whiteflower, a small, beautiful flower that grows very low to the ground.  Its fibres imitate the pattern of a flower's petals, and droop low, the plant reaching a maximum height of about six inches.  It is rare enough, hard to cultivate, and even more difficult to harvest.  The usual method involves crawling on hands and knees to pull the fibres off the plant, placing them in a satchel for later processing.  Because of these factors, and the strength of the fabric it produces, raw whiteflower is very valuable, with a bolt of it selling for between ten and fifty times as much as that of cotton or wool.
SILVERWEED_SID=silverweed
UNID_SILVERWEED_SID=spotted, silver flower
SILVERWEED_USAGE_SID=a silverweed
UNID_SILVERWEED_USAGE_SID=a spotted, silver flower
SILVERWEED_CODEX_SID=No one knows whether silverweed is magic or not.  Named for its silver leaves speckled with small, white dots, the plant contains the nutrition of a five-course feast.  The taste itself starts bitter, but finishes herbal, earning it the nickname of "bittermint".  Once picked, it stays fresh for a remarkably long time, comparable with salted meat or fish.  Travellers will often keep silverweed in reserve in case of an emergency, should they ever become lost or fail to forage for food.
CORPSE_SID=corpse
CORPSE_USAGE_SID=a corpse
CORPSE_CODEX_SID=The body of something once living, now dead.
INTACT_SKELETON_SID=intact skeleton
INTACT_SKELETON_USAGE_SID=an intact skeleton
INTACT_SKELETON_CODEX_SID=The skeleton of something - it looks humanoid, and remarkably, is fully intact.  Many discovered skeletons are missing bones, scavenged by animals or other creatures, but this one, for whatever reasons, has been left alone, and it stares back at you with hollow, unblinking eyes.
APPLE_SID=apple
APPLE_USAGE_SID=an apple
APPLE_CODEX_SID=Probably the most common fruit, apples are nutritious and filling, and have varieties for every climate.  More importantly, their juice can be easily turned into alcohol.  The central lands have cultivated sweet, crisp apples, while many of the outlying islands contain varieties that have evolved uniquely over millennia.  In the fall, when the apples are harvested, people keep them carefully stacked in apple barrels, storing these in their cellars to enjoy fruit through the winter.  The bruised fruit at harvest is often used to make apple cider which, given a sufficient alcohol concentration, can help fortify oneself for the long, winter months.
ROOT_SID=edible root
ROOT_USAGE_SID=an edible root
ROOT_CODEX_SID=Starchy, edible roots form an important part of many people's diets.  Easy to grow, they are hardy enough to withstand insects, fungus, and poor weather, while at the same time making effective use of the soil, growing in long, individual roots, or in wide clusters.  Once dug up, they keep well if stored in a cool place, and even the poorest families will have root cellars of some kind, to ward off starvation during the long and bitter winters.
BERRIES_SID=berries
BERRIES_USAGE_SID=a handful of berries
BERRIES_CODEX_SID=Sweet or tart, large or tiny, there are an almost innumerable variety of berries.  They are often eaten on their own, or made into jams and preserves.  However, there are a variety of uses beyond that - dyes for clothing, flavouring for grain alcohols, or used for medicinal properties specific to a certain plant.  Most improve the function of the arteries, preventing the buildup of plaque, and though sailors often bring lemons and limes on sea-voyages to prevent scurvy, vitamin C is also present in berries.  Sailors will often stock barrels of sweetburn, a drink created with a mixture of berry juice and strong grain spirits.  The alcohol helps preserve the drink, while the berries keep the sea-dogs' canines from dropping into the sea.
KELP_SID=kelp
KELP_USAGE_SID=kelp
KELP_CODEX_SID=A kind of seaweed, kelp grows in forests under salt water, typically in shallower points where some dim light still filters down from the surface.  Some varieties are edible, and when rinsed, dried, and pressed flat, form a paper-like substance with a distinctly salty taste.  Kelp forests form the basis of entire ecosystems, sheltering crabs and sea-urchins, starfish and jellyfish, and the long strands of kelp play a key role in sustaining the biodiversity of the world's oceans.
BLACKROOT_SID=blackroot
BLACKROOT_USAGE_SID=a blackroot
BLACKROOT_CODEX_SID=A dark, shrivelled root, spotted with white, blackroot looks all the world like a parsnip or carrot that has grown mold and gone off.  But this root, rare but wild, found in fields by the keen-eyed, has the ability to close up wounds, staunch bleeding, and lend aid to the wounded.  The well-prepared bring bundles of this when travelling, and it is popular in marketplaces and bazaars everywhere.
VERBENA_SID=verbena
VERBENA_USAGE_SID=a handful of verbena
VERBENA_CODEX_SID=A flowering plant, verbena is known for its magical properties.  Spellcasters have noted that after consuming its sweet petals, they feel remarkably refreshed, and those who travel will often press this flower between the pages of their tomes.  For this reason, it is also called bookflower, and it is as effective dried as fresh.  Its colourful flowers have powerful dyes, and the tongues of those who eat these can be stained blue, red, or white for days.
WHITE_BASIL_SID=white basil
WHITE_BASIL_USAGE_SID=a handful of white basil
WHITE_BASIL_CODEX_SID=How many dead adventurers litter the world's dungeons because they were afflicted by poison, had no remedies, and fell out of favour with the divine?  Antidote potions can be bought from hedge wizards and witches, but just as effective is the white basil plant, whose fragrant leaves release antitoxins into the blood.  This plant is fickle, and requires abundant sunlight and water; beyond that, those who have tried to cultivate it and earn riches off its medicinal properties have found that, after a generation or two, the plants' effect disappears, and it is reduced to little more than a common herb, good for little more than cooking or tying in bunches around the home for its pleasant scent.
STONEFLOWER_SID=stoneflower
STONEFLOWER_USAGE_SID=a stoneflower
STONEFLOWER_CODEX_SID=Looking like a small, monochromatic daisy, the light grey petals of the stoneflower have a queer, sour flavour.  However, behind the unpleasant taste is something far more valuable: the capability to halt petrification.  Stoneflower is an adventurer's best friend, and those trained in foraging will carry bunches of these in their backpacks.  The flowers are only good until they begin to wilt.  After that, the moisture leaving the petals, they themselves seem to turn to stone, becoming firm to the touch before finally crumbling away.
VOXFLOWER_SID=voxflower
VOXFLOWER_USAGE_SID=a voxflower
VOXFLOWER_CODEX_SID=Muteness, whether from sickness or the terrifying power of the divine, is something every spellcaster learns to fear.  To be rendered dumb is to be unable to cast any kind of magic, but a bit of voxflower will restore the voice.  This fibrous plant looks much like cotton, but its bolls dissolve on the tongue, sweet like candy.  Within seconds, the vocal cords are restored, and whatever inflicted the muteness on the caster must deal with the consequences - and quickly.
CHERRIES_SID=cherries
CHERRIES_USAGE_SID=a handful of cherries
CHERRIES_CODEX_SID=Typically preferring more temperate climate, some cherry varieties have adapted to the colder climates at the edge of the world.  Cherry trees are known for their eruption of blossoms in spring.  These are usually pink, but flower in other colours as well, such as white or yellow.  Cherries can be sweet or tart, with the tarter varieties often used to create cherry brandy, or to flavour beer.  Cherry beers are particularly loved by the wood elves, who often tend cherry orchards deep within their old forests, clearing the space around the trees to allow sufficient light, heat, and precipitation.  Some of these beers are aged for years, brought out for special occasions; others are enjoyed young, tapped from oak casks to take the edge off a hot summer day.
PEACH_SID=peach
PEACH_USAGE_SID=a peach
PEACH_CODEX_SID=A sweet, fuzzy-skinned fruit, peaches grow in the more temperate parts of the world.  When ripe, the soft, juicy flesh is often enjoyed on its own, but is also very popular in baking: peach pies and crumbles, pasties, and cookies all common at harvest time.  Many travellers enjoy them cooked on their own, cooked on portable grills, and sweetened further with a drop of honey when this is available.
PLUM_SID=plum
PLUM_USAGE_SID=a plum
PLUM_CODEX_SID=Purple-red fruits, plums tend towards sweetness.  They are widely used in baking, such as plum tarts or pie, and a plum pudding is traditional at winter festivals.  These sometimes substitute other fruits for plums - raisins, for example, or currants - while still retaining the name, but plums themselves are considered traditional.  Plum trees flower brilliantly in spring, the pink blossoms echoing the deep red tones of the late summer fruit to come.
PEAR_SID=pear
PEAR_USAGE_SID=a pear
PEAR_CODEX_SID=Pear trees are fussy, and grow in the milder regions of the world.  The fruit, wide-based and tapering at the top, is edible for a short period of time.  Unlike other fruits, pears do not ripen on the tree.  They reach peak ripeness when picked, and so farmers must carefully plan their harvest accordingly.  Hard and crisp until ripe, pears then quickly transform, becoming soft, sweet, and juicy.  Pears are said to have some kind of special significance to the Nine, and harvest sacrifices always include a basket of ripe pears, fragrant when offered underneath the late-summer sun.
OLIVE_SID=olive
OLIVE_USAGE_SID=an olive
OLIVE_CODEX_SID=Olive trees grow only in warm climates, producing the olives that are characteristic of the cuisines of those regions.  Besides the use of the fruit itself, olives produce a flavourful, fragrant oil used for both cooking and religious purposes.  The trees themselves are known to have significant lifespans.  Some trees are estimated to be a thousand years old or more, and it's thought that some trees on the Isle of Carcassia are older than the empire itself.
GOLDEN_APPLE_SID=golden apple
GOLDEN_APPLE_USAGE_SID=a golden apple
GOLDEN_APPLE_CODEX_SID=It's said that after Vedere created the world, the first thing to grow was an apple tree, its leaves gold, red-veined, that tree producing a single fruit which he plucked from the bough.  Taking this, he broke it apart, and found a million seeds inside.  He scattered these to the wind, which carried them around the world and from this, all the species of plants were born.  The tree itself withered away, but echoes of it can be found in the magical golden apple tree, which blooms a brilliant yellow in spring, producing fruit that course with a strange magical strength.
SILVER_APPLE_SID=silver apple
SILVER_APPLE_USAGE_SID=a silver apple
SILVER_APPLE_CODEX_SID=After Vedere created the world, he looked at the many different plants, and was pleased with what he had created.  But of all the trees and flowers, nothing matched the beauty of the golden apple tree that had been their genesis.  And so he created a second divine tree, its bark grey-and-white, its springtime bloom white but glittering like diamonds in the midday sun.  And on the branches, a silver fruit grew, filled with the purest essence of divine magic; it's said that when the fruit falls off the tree, when the apples begin to rot and become consumed by wasps, that the magic leaches out into the earth, mixing with minerals and becoming shards of magici underground.
VEGETABLE1_SID=cabbage
VEGETABLE1_USAGE_SID=a cabbage
VEGETABLE1_CODEX_SID=Cabbage, both red and green, is cheap and easy to grow, and about the most generous thing that can be said is that it isn't totally devoid of nutritional content.  It is largely fibre and water, and so while filling, it can only really supplement a diet, rather than form the basis for one.  In richer countries, it is enjoyed shredded as a kind of salad, while most peasants make stews with cabbage, other vegetables, and whatever meat they can spare.
VEGETABLE2_SID=carrot
VEGETABLE2_USAGE_SID=a carrot
VEGETABLE2_CODEX_SID=Orange root vegetables, carrots are well-known for their health benefits, and since they grow in all forms of soil, have been incorporated into most cultures' cuisines.  Carrots have long been linked to better eyesight - one legend tells of an old king who, planning a night attack against his enemies, had every soldier in his army put on a steady diet of carrots for several weeks, to the point where the waterways around his capital were said to run orange.
VEGETABLE3_SID=potato
VEGETABLE3_USAGE_SID=a potato
VEGETABLE3_CODEX_SID=One of the most space efficient crops, potatoes grow underneath potato hills created by planting single piece of potato with the eyes present.  The potatoes grown off seed potatoes can be dug up earlier in the season if baby potatoes are desired, or later once the crop reaches its full size.  Potatoes are starchy, filling, and calorie-rich.  They also keep for long periods of time, when stored out of sunlight, in cool, dry places, and because of this make up the core of the lower classes' winter meals.
VEGETABLE4_SID=turnip
VEGETABLE4_USAGE_SID=a turnip
VEGETABLE4_CODEX_SID=Popular especially in soups and stews, turnips are rich in vitamins and minerals.  In many dishes, mashed potatoes can be substituted by mashed turnips.  The colour of the taproot ranges from white to red, and the so-called imperial turnip, cultivated in Carcassia, is restricted to the emperor's gardens, its flesh a deep purple in appearance.
VEGETABLE5_SID=spinach
VEGETABLE5_USAGE_SID=some spinach
VEGETABLE5_CODEX_SID=Loathed by children, supposedly loved by adults who convince themselves that it's really not that bad, honestly, really, spinach is easy to grow, and with regular watering, grows into large, leafy plants.  Its leaves are often eaten raw, in salads, but wilt down quickly and several handfuls can help to fill out a pot of soup.  Spinach has high levels of vitamin C, known to help fend off scurvy, and is used in dishes in many regions that are not able to grow other staple sources, such as oranges and other citrus fruits.
VEGETABLE6_SID=tomato
VEGETABLE6_USAGE_SID=a tomato
VEGETABLE6_CODEX_SID=Tomatoes make efficient use of space in people's tiny gardens, the stalks growing several feet high and, later in the summer, becoming heavy with fruit.  Turning green-to-red, the fruit itself varies in size from grape and cherry varieties, up to massive beefsteak tomatoes that hang precariously off the vine.  Tomatoes are enjoyed in as many ways as there are people: with lumps of fresh cheese, drizzled with oil and vinegar; pureed in soups, cut into chunks for beef stew; or simply on their own, sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt with every bite.
FOOD_RATION_SID=food ration
FOOD_RATION_USAGE_SID=a food ration
FOOD_RATION_CODEX_SID=Enough food for a pair of meals, food rations are intended to be just enough to take care of a day of adventuring.  They are filling, but by no means nutritionally complete - travellers will typically supplement with fresh herbs and vegetables found or dug up along the way.  Food rations are tied into a small package that fits easily into a satchel or backpack, and consist of two large pieces of hardtack, some nuts, a chunk of firm cheese, and several strips of salted fish or meat.
LUNCH_SID=lunch
LUNCH_USAGE_SID=a lunch
LUNCH_CODEX_SID=Each day, shopkeepers wake up early in the morning and prepare to sell their wares.  As one day blends into the next, the merchants' lives become an endless parade of selling and haggling, sourcing wares for purchase - an exhausting process that requires a large boost of energy in the middle of the day.  Shuffling off towards their shops, merchants carry with them their lunches, lovingly packed by their mothers or wives, and as often as not, furtively offer these for sale with everything else.  "Fresh and delicious!  Packed just today!"
TROUT_SID=rainbow trout
TROUT_USAGE_SID=a rainbow trout
TROUT_CODEX_SID=Freshwater fish that live in lakes and rivers, trout are often known as "rainbow trout" for the shimmer of colour on their scales.  They are common in the wild, easily farmed, and have a mild taste that takes on other flavours in dishes.  Smoked, salted trout is particularly popular, cheap, a common staple food among the adventuring classes.
CARP_SID=river carp
CARP_USAGE_SID=a river carp
CARP_CODEX_SID=An ugly, large-bodied fish, carp can grow to enormous sizes when left alone.  Wide-eyed, whiskered, and with huge, gaping mouths, they are not particularly attractive to look at, but their flesh is plentiful, and the head presents less of a problem when removed during preparation.  Specimens have been caught weighing a hundred pounds or more, and in coastal regions, it is customary to serve a whole, massive carp as the centrepiece of a wedding day feast.
PIKE_SID=northern pike
PIKE_USAGE_SID=a northern pike
PIKE_CODEX_SID=Known in some regions as jackfish, the pike is a long-bodied, long-faced fish whose name comes from comparison to the polearm of the same name.  Found in cooler climates, pike live largely outside the boundaries of the Carcassian empire, where their rarity makes them something of a delicacy - there they tend to be eaten salted, or imported packed in ice at great cost.  Pike are known to be mean-spirited, and have a vicious bite; more than one fisherman has been afflicted with digitless condition known as "pikefinger".
SALMON_SID=sockeye salmon
SALMON_USAGE_SID=a sockeye salmon
SALMON_CODEX_SID=Salmon are born in freshwater streams and rivers.  Migrating downstream, they move to the great oceans where they feed and grow to maturity.  Once they have reached their full size, they find their way back to where they were born, to spawn and then die.  During this re-migration, they must fight their way upstream, sometimes leaping several feet in the air to avoid obstacles and predators, forced to contend with bears and other carnivores looking to gorge and build fat stores for the winter.  Salmon has a particular taste, not as neutral as some other fish, and is often salted by coastal people on a shaded stage, the children cutting evergreen boughs to provide extra protection from the sun, to prevent the salt-caked meat from taking heat and spoiling.
TUNA_SID=yellowfin tuna
TUNA_USAGE_SID=a yellowfin tuna
TUNA_CODEX_SID=Tuna are saltwater fish whose meat is prized as a delicacy.  It is normally served as steaks, served raw or rare, often simply seared with a bit of salt and lemon.  Because of its economic value, and proximity to the large fishing fleets that roam the central waters, tuna stocks are currently in danger.  Though the populations have been known to rise and fall, the boats are coming back with fewer and fewer fish each season, and many think that it's just a matter of time before the tuna is fished to extinction.
COD_SID=southern cod
COD_USAGE_SID=a southern cod
COD_CODEX_SID=The southern seas are full of cod.  Too far from the central lands to be economically viable to fish, the southern oceans are sparsely habited, with few large settlements.  Their islands, too, tend to be resource-poor, and so the fleets of ships common in the oceans around Carcassia are nowhere to be seen.  With this lack of harvesting, the cod has thrived.  It forms a staple among the southern fishing communities, delicate and flaky when cooked properly, and it's said that the massive schools of cod could feed the southern lands until the end of time.
TRAIL_RATION_SID=trail ration
TRAIL_RATION_USAGE_SID=a trail ration
TRAIL_RATION_CODEX_SID=More dense and rich than food rations, trail rations are meant to be enough food for a long day of hiking.  Pemmican is substituted for salted meat or fish, and some kind of dense cake, often seed cake, serves as an additional snack.
SALTED_FISH_SID=salted fish
SALTED_FISH_USAGE_SID=a salted fish
SALTED_FISH_CODEX_SID=Salt preserves meat by keeping it dry, with the bacteria that cause food poisoning unable to take hold in the absence of moisture.  In fishing towns around the world, salt stages are set up to preserve the lower grade fish for sale or export to poorer regions.  Salted fish has long been a part of many adventurers' diets.  It keeps well, is nutritious, and can be found at pretty much any port throughout the world.
BOWL_STEWED_MEAT_SID=bowl of stewed meat
BOWL_STEWED_MEAT_USAGE_SID=a bowl of stewed meat
BOWL_STEWED_MEAT_CODEX_SID=Innkeepers do brisk business in ale at certain hours of the day, but need to provide food to their patrons and visitors as well.  Most kitchens will have a simple menu of steaks or meat patties served with potatoes and vegetables, and the excess meat goes into the stew-pot along with some water, seasonings, and a bit of flour to thicken.  Over the course of the day, exactly what the stew is might change dramatically.  But, like the mystery beer created by tipping all the mostly-empty casks ito a new barrel, an innkeeper's stew has the overriding advantage of being cheap.
SALTED_NUTS_SID=handful of salted nuts
SALTED_NUTS_USAGE_SID=a handful of salted nuts
SALTED_NUTS_CODEX_SID=A popular snack at the fighting pits, the nutritional value of a good handful of nuts is cancelled out when tossed with a bit of oil and a shocking amount of salt.  These paper packages tend to be so heavily salted that some sort of drink is always required, and by sheer coincidence, the same vendors that sell the nuts also happen to sell beer and cider as well.
SKEWER_MYSTERY_MEAT_SID=skewer of mystery meat
SKEWER_MYSTERY_MEAT_USAGE_SID=a skewer of mystery meat
SKEWER_MYSTERY_MEAT_CODEX_SID=It smells faintly of raccoon and sadness.
WILDFLOWER1_SID=red wildflower
WILDFLOWER1_USAGE_SID=a red wildflower
WILDFLOWER1_CODEX_SID=Dragon's Breath, orange-red flower; Red Mary, its deep crimson, tiny black centre.  Bella's Bane: faintly acrid, a bitterer for beer.  Southern Sunset.  So few red flowers in the wild, the hue held back, colourant of a second world.  Wilting Star, its bloom and curl; Little Aster, startling, its small shape standing for the sun.
WILDFLOWER2_SID=yellow wildflower
WILDFLOWER2_USAGE_SID=a yellow wildflower
WILDFLOWER2_CODEX_SID=Butter-bell, a better fox-glove, its flowers sweet on the tongue, and safe.  Lowella's Ladies, those blossoming stocks drooping low, bowing in reverence.  Corona and Vista, high-flowered; Fairy Ring, deep-rooted, circular, appearing suddenly one morning to watch over the garden.  Yellow loosestrife.  The simple marigold.  Gilder's Gold.
WILDFLOWER3_SID=a blue wildflower
WILDFLOWER3_USAGE_SID=a blue wildflower
WILDFLOWER3_CODEX_SID=By the seaside, the small flowers lie under the hard wind and salt-spray as if to say: "this is enough for me - why not you?"  Bluebells and sea-girls, cobalt crown, gullweed; saltwater daisy, false sapphire, sailor's promise.  Bluesky, spring clover.  Wild flax further in, then racing to the shore, Selkie's Skin, oily in your hand.
WILDFLOWER4_SID=magenta wildflower
WILDFLOWER4_USAGE_SID=a magenta wildflower
WILDFLOWER4_CODEX_SID=Emperor's Seal, flower of an old empire, its cultivation punished by death outside the capital.  The proclamation pernicious, presaging hard fate, future fire.  Small plants passed as cuttings, ferried out on ships, planted on islets and remote islands, tended to as the sea-lanes allowed, the number increasing year after year after year.  Passed around to nobles and rabble, saboteurs, placed in the lapel, till the day they found change with flowers and a knife.
WILDFLOWER5_SID=cyan wildflower
WILDFLOWER5_USAGE_SID=a cyan wildflower
WILDFLOWER5_CODEX_SID=Little-seen.  As a colour, mistaken: seafoam or teal, potentially turquoise.  Small-petalled flowers, found in tallgrass, hovering at the fringes.  A divine mistake, colours fading, they say, under canopies of filtered sun.  True blueberry: pale flower, the darker fruit.  Beggar's Cup and Foxflower, ladybells; fairythorn, the tiny woodland rose.
WILDFLOWER6_SID=cream wildflower
WILDFLOWER6_USAGE_SID=a cream wildflower
WILDFLOWER6_CODEX_SID=Wild strawberry, white-flowered, a sign of future fruit.  Snowfall and Angelhair, last to appear, a sign that winter must be coming soon.  Daisies.  White-moon.  Pale belladonna.  So many varieties of lily: lake-blossom of water lily, queen-lily's gilded edge.  Dove verbena.  Alabaster drops.  Edelweiss, prize of impassable peaks; the swan rose, its cresting, impossible bloom.
HIDE_SLING_SID=%s-hide sling
HIDE_SLING_USAGE_SID=a %s-hide sling
SLING_SID=sling
SLING_USAGE_SID=a sling
SLING_CODEX_SID=A thin strap of leather with a small pouch, slings allow stones to be launched faster and further than if thrown by hand.  Requiring only a bit of animal hide and little in the way of specialized tools, slings are easier to make than bows, and have the advantage that their ammunition can be picked up off the ground anywhere.  Slingers have featured prominently in a number of military battles, for their mobility allows them to flank, fire, and run.  If more heavily armoured troops follow them, they will tire quickly, and become victims of further attacks.  These small stones are not just for harrasment: they can break bones, tear the skin, and cause internal bleeding.  Slingers are often seen as among the lowliest in any army, but the infantry will easily admit that they're happy not to have to face down a brutal hail of stones.
PELTER_SID=silent sling "Pelter"
PELTER_USAGE_SID=the silent sling "Pelter"
PELTER_CODEX_SID=Said to be made from the hide of a tarasque, Pelter has a permanent cantrip cast upon it to nullify the sound nearby.  This affects an area of about two feet in each direction, so that when the stone is cradled and spun, no sound can be heard.  It's thought that Pelter was a creation of the mountain elves, who used it to silently hunt the enormous sheep and rams high within their mountains before pushing the corpses onto sleds and pulling them home.
CROSSBOW_SID=crossbow
CROSSBOW_USAGE_SID=a crossbow
CROSSBOW_CODEX_SID=A crossbow is a bow mounted horizontally on an apparatus that allows it to be easily drawn and fired.  Crossbows are bulkier and take longer to reload than regular bows, but this is offset by the fact that anyone can use one, so long as they can pull the trigger.  The crossbow requires little in the way of strength, with the use of a winch allowing the crossbow to be cocked and fired again.
SHADOW_SID=black hand crossbow "Shadow"
SHADOW_USAGE_SID=the black hand crossbow "Shadow"
SHADOW_CODEX_SID=Belonging to the great thief Thispin, Shadow was his prize possession: a small, intricate hand crossbow, stolen from a wyrm's lair.  While planning his brazen burglary, Thispin knew that any sound would bring death, and so he carried nothing with him into those caverns, and brought back nothing but the crossbow.  It is tiny, seeming more like a child's toy than an instrument of death.  But it is easily concealed, and something in its complicated mechanical workings allow it to not just fire bolts at incredible speeds, but also automatically reload them from a separate compartment.  After Thispin's death, it was, by his will, buried with him.  But thieves being thieves, nobody thinks it's still beneath the earth.
BOW_SID=bow
BOW_USAGE_SID=a bow
BOW_CODEX_SID=Made from a curved piece of wood and a taut string, sometimes fibres such as silk or hemp but also commonly animal gut, the bow is in simple terms a launcher for arrows.  Simple to make, and portable, it is popular not just for its effectiveness but for the fact that an archer can carry a large number of arrows - typically dozens, and sometimes a hundred or more.  Smaller examples are more versatile, capable of being fired kneeling, prone, or on horseback, while larger longbows can arc an arrow a mile or more, and are fired standing, requiring great strength to obtain a proper draw.
LONGBOW_OF_PELAGEUS_SID=longbow of the Dragonlord Pelageus
LONGBOW_OF_PELAGEUS_USAGE_SID=the longbow of the Dragonlord Pelageus
LONGBOW_OF_PELAGEUS_CODEX_SID=During the Dragon Age, one of the most feared Dragon Lords was the sorceror Pelageus.  From the skies, he directed his armies, his dragon-mount breathing fire and terrifying his enemies below.  Pelageus always brought into combat an enormous yew bow, from which he'd loosely fire arrows to the earth, guiding and transforming them as they went: into small comets, massive shards of ice, screaming the words of magic after each arrow had taken flight.  Ultimately, his forces, and those of the other Dragon Lords, were defeated by a coalition of the races.  His body tumbled from the heavens, and his mighty bow was lost, not seen in the thousands of years since.
POISON_DART_SID=poison dart
POISON_DART_USAGE_SID=a poison dart
POISON_DART_CODEX_SID=There are many ways to kill.  Large weapons like greatswords and battleaxes offer the most straightforward example, but a pinprick is just as deadly, if followed up correctly.  Poison darts are favoured by thieves and assassins, who do their work in darkness and whose lives and reputations depend on not being seen.  A bit of poison can be deadly if the victim is weak, or old, or simply unprepared, lacking suitable potions or herbs.  Once in the bloodstream, the poison does its work, causing internal bleeding, shutting down organs, and if left unchecked, eventually causing death.
TOOTH_ANCIENT_SEA_CREATURE_SID=tooth of an ancient sea-creature
TOOTH_ANCIENT_SEA_CREATURE_USAGE_SID=a tooth of an ancient sea-creature
TOOTH_ANCIENT_SEA_CREATURE_CODEX_SID=In the oceans before recorded time, strange creatures swam blind along the frigid ocean floor.  Their hair-thin, needle-like teeth contained a powerful toxin that quickly killed whatever they bit.  A strange kind of dart, but wildly effective - a few of these have washed up on coastlines over the millennia, the poison somehow still intact, and even one of these could command a king's random to the right buyer.
FIRE_BOMB_SID=fire bomb
FIRE_BOMB_USAGE_SID=a fire bomb
FIRE_BOMB_CODEX_SID=Pedants would simply call this "a bomb", but alchemists everywhere point out that "fire bomb" sounds better.  These items are as varied as the alchemists who construct them.  Some are simply sacks of explosive powder with shards of metal and nails, while others come in a small, steel casing, which fragments outward on explosion.  The powders used for these are kept secret, the exact ingredients and formulations known only by the alchemists themselves.  Fire bombs are especially loved by goblins, who delight in the destruction that these can cause, and who don't think too hard about whether it's a great idea to be loaded down with a half-dozen satchels of explosive powder.
SHADOW_BOMB_SID=shadow bomb
SHADOW_BOMB_USAGE_SID=a shadow bomb
SHADOW_BOMB_CODEX_SID=Also known as "statuemakers", these are not a true bomb in terms of an explosive, fiery force.  But they work on a roughly analogous principle: unstable Primordial magics are bound to a particular object, which then fragments on impact, releasing corrupting tendrils of magic.  As these touch the skin, it stiffens, and if untreated, leads to a slow and agonizing death as the victim is slowly petrified.  The limbs go first, and those who have been brought back from the very limits of this speak of how, in the end, all they can do is breathe, their eyes fixed in the place, their lungs slowly and excruciatingly tightening.
CHAOS_BOMB_SID=chaos bomb
CHAOS_BOMB_USAGE_SID=a chaos bomb
CHAOS_BOMB_CODEX_SID=One of the last Elysians, near-immortal in the sheathing magics of Telari, The Smith has a number of unique creations.  One of these are chaos bombs, fragmentary explosives packed with ancient magici shards brought with his people when they fled the wrath of the Nine.  These shards are far more unstable and powerful than the magici lining the world at present - not just a source of magical power, they are also unpredictable and mutable.  Judiciously added to the chaos bombs, they are devastating.  After the powerful explosion, they are able to inflict all possible status ailments.  They allow the thrower an unfair advantage in any fight, and can level out the expected disparities when stepping out into the cosmos to face the wrath of the Nine and their hateful heavenly legions.
JAVELIN_SID=javelin
JAVELIN_USAGE_SID=a javelin
JAVELIN_CODEX_SID=A throwing spear approximately ten feet in length, the javelin is used by a number of cultures as their primary ranged weapon.  Though they can be stopped by a sufficient amount of armour, javelins have a distinct advantage over arrows in that once they embed within a shield or breastplate, they become incredibly awkward, forcing the target to spend time either hacking off the head, or pulling the javelin out altogether.  For those lucky enough to survive battle after battle, javelins are also more durable.  Arrows are easily broken, but javelins can be recovered more often than not, allowing armies to ensure that their stocks are replenished quickly after a battle in case they are needed again soon.
BARBED_SPEAR_SID=barbed spear
BARBED_SPEAR_USAGE_SID=a barbed spear
BARBED_SPEAR_CODEX_SID=Barbed spears function like javelins, but the heads are forged in such a way that a number of sick barbs protrude back.  These catch the skin, and make the spearhead exceptionally hard to remove.  These must be cut out carefully: if they are pulled out, they can cause a tremendous amount of damage, removing a chunk of flesh and leaving a wound that is difficult to staunch, and which becomes an invitation for infection.  Their effectiveness and wicked barbs cause them to be favoured by snakelings, many of whom carry two to three of these on their backs, and can hurl them with great speed and precision.
WINGED_JAVELIN_SID=winged javelin
WINGED_JAVELIN_USAGE_SID=a winged javelin
WINGED_JAVELIN_CODEX_SID=Enchanted with hedge magics, winged javelins are feathered at the end, like long, thrown arrows.  But the magics within allow them to achieve an incredible velocity and distance.  When arced, these can carry a mile or more, as if fired by an enormous longbow, leaving the arm with speeds greater than that of an ordinary crossbow.  Winged javelins are sometimes found deep in dungeons, and are met with great excitement, as their discovery offers protection on the way back up, not to mention the promise of a tidy profit should the finder live to sell them later.
SPINE_ANCIENT_HORROR_SID=spine of an ancient horror
SPINE_ANCIENT_HORROR_USAGE_SID=a spine of an ancient horror
SPINE_ANCIENT_HORROR_CODEX_SID=The spine of some terrifying creature out of the cold depths of the cosmos, this weapon bristles with hooks and barbs.  Exactly what this belonged to is unknowable, but at more than thirty feet in length, the size of the creature can be guessed.  On impact, these tear through armour and skin, ripping through steel as if paper, pulsing with chaotic energies.  If the victim survives, which is unlikely, they might be spellbound or petrified, blinded, exposed, disfigured.  Only a tiny number of these have ever been found, with only one recorded usage as a weapon; the rarity of these ensures that they make their way back to chiefs and kings, who hang them above their halls as a testament to the glory of their house and name.
THROWING_CLUB_SID=throwing club
THROWING_CLUB_USAGE_SID=a throwing club
THROWING_CLUB_CODEX_SID=Throwing clubs come in a number of forms, ranging from well-carved clubs that tumble predictably in flight, to boomerang-like sticks capable of extended distances.  They are more cumbersome to carry than other ranged weapons, and because of this, they are used far less frequently, preferred only in cultures where metalworking is not practiced, or among those who have few other options than to take a suitably-sized stick and throw it.
CABER_SID=caber
CABER_USAGE_SID=a caber
CABER_CODEX_SID=An enormous tree trunk, meant to be lobbed.  Accuracy is poor, but it hurts like hell.
TITANIC_HEAVENLY_PILLAR_SID=titanic heavenly pillar
TITANIC_HEAVENLY_PILLAR_USAGE_SID=a titanic heavenly pillar
TITANIC_HEAVENLY_PILLAR_CODEX_SID=Resembling an ancient column, but forged of some lightweight metal, the heavenly pillars are the creation of The Smith.  Within they contain hundreds of small stones, which rattle about noisily.  These serve to shift the balance when held aloft, allowing it to feel more natural.  And once the pillar is thrown, they move to the other end, helping guide it to the ground and bringing a crushing amount of weight down in an area roughly the size of a man's fist.
MASSIVE_FERRIC_METEORITE_SID=massive ferric meteorite
MASSIVE_FERRIC_METEORITE_USAGE_SID=a massive ferric meteorite
MASSIVE_FERRIC_METEORITE_CODEX_SID=Cabers are for weenies: real heroes crush their foes with the remnants of massive meteorites.
THROWING_AXE_SID=throwing axe
THROWING_AXE_USAGE_SID=a throwing axe
THROWING_AXE_CODEX_SID=Popular as a short-range throwing weapon with a number of armies, throwing axes are light, sharp, and capable of causing a great deal of damage on impact.  Most importantly, they don't take up the use of both hands like a bow and arrows, allowing a foot soldier to hold a sword or larger axe in one hand, get off a quick throw, and then run in to finish the job in melee combat.
ELYSIAN_THROWING_AXE_SID=Elysian throwing axe
ELYSIAN_THROWING_AXE_USAGE_SID=an Elysian throwing axe
ELYSIAN_THROWING_AXE_CODEX_SID=The Elysian throwing axe looks almost nothing like an axe at all.  Having a central handle sheathed in almost all directions by a blade, the weapon's design ensures that however it falls, if it hits, it will embed.  Each one is layered with magics to cut through the divine: these are weapons meant to challenge the heavens themselves.
THROWING_SWORD_SID=throwing sword
THROWING_SWORD_USAGE_SID=a throwing sword
THROWING_SWORD_CODEX_SID=Really just an especially large throwing knife, throwing swords are heavy and a bit unwieldy.  Those who use them will carry only one or two, and often will use one as an improvised melee weapon.  Lacking a cross-guard, these are not really meant for hand to hand combat, as they leave the hand and wrist exposed and vulnerable.  When thrown, the foot-long blade can cause tremendous suffering, and those who use these will often coat the blade will all kinds of things - poisons, dirt, excrement - to ensure that, even if the target survives the battle, they will suffer tremendously for it.
ELYSIAN_THROWING_SWORD_SID=Elysian throwing sword
ELYSIAN_THROWING_SWORD_USAGE_SID=an Elysian throwing sword
ELYSIAN_THROWING_SWORD_CODEX_SID=A double-bladed sword with a central handle, the Elysian throwing sword is a thing of magic.  As it leaves the hand, it flies like a javelin.  But then, caught by some unseen wind, it begins to tumble.  End over end, it finds its target, its blessed blades ignoring armour as they lodge deep within.  These throwing swords seem to have their own will.  When divine creatures are nearby, they quiver with urgency, and may correct their own course to fly away from an intended target to seek out those divine creatures which they were forged and enchanted to slay.
CORACLE_SID=coracle
CORACLE_USAGE_SID=a coracle
CORACLE_CODEX_SID=Coracles are small, lightweight boats, typically large enough to hold only a single person.  The core shape is built from wicker, and made watertight by stretching hides outside the frame.  Coracles are often used by single fishers, who take them out into ponds and rivers to catch a few fish.  They cannot take much weight, and face stability issues and capsizing in the face of strong winds.  Because of this, they are rarely taken out to sea, except for short trips around shorelines.  But they serve their purpose well, and are easy to make, requiring few specialized tools, and so they remain a popular choice for fishers around the world.
RAFT_SID=raft
RAFT_USAGE_SID=a raft
RAFT_CODEX_SID=Rafts are buoyant platforms used to navigate all kinds of waters, from lakes and rivers to even the open sea.  The platform is typically created by lashing timbers together.  In the simplest rafts, these form the entirety of the structure, though more complicated and stable rafts can be created by building the structure on top of a series of barrels.  This provides a bit more separation between the sailors and the water, and helps the platform restabilize itself quickly in the face of bad weather.  The sealed barrels and spacing between the timbers allow any water to drain off quickly, and with some ropes or straps, seafarers stand a decent chance of getting through a sudden storm at sea.
ROWBOAT_SID=rowboat
ROWBOAT_USAGE_SID=a rowboat
ROWBOAT_CODEX_SID=A rowboat is any small boat propelled entirely by oars.  These can be rowed by a single person, or just easily by a pair of people, with the boats themselves typically having a capacity of six to eight.  The boats are usually made with overlapping, narrow planks of wood.  These made be sealed somehow, such as with tar or pitch, but some boats are constructed to require no sealant at all, the timbers swelling when wet to become watertight.  After a winter off the water, the first few trips require a great deal of bailing; but after a week or two on the water, the timbers find their sea-legs, and after that, very little maintenance will be required.
CURRENCY_SID=ivory pieces
CURRENCY_USAGE_SID=some ivory pieces
CURRENCY_CODEX_SID=Gold and silver are unevenly distributed, with some regions being far richer than the others.  As a result, different cultures, when looking to trade with each other, turned to the one thing both rare and yet available everywhere: ivory.  Ivory is the universal currency, taken from sea-creatures such as whales and walruses, land animals such as rhinoceroses, elephants, and elk.  Rarest of all are the spiralling ivory pieces cut from the tusk of the narwhal, sea-porpoises that live in the deadly cold waters of the far northern seas.
SKELETON_KEY_SID=skeleton key
SKELETON_KEY_USAGE_SID=the skeleton key
SKELETON_KEY_CODEX_SID=An interesting bit of magic, the end of the skeleton key looks to be made of metal, but instantly reshapes itself when placed into any lock.  It is cold to the touch, and emits a strange blue light.  It is also, as far as anyone can tell, completely indestructible.  Found in a dragon's hoard, dropped into the ocean, buried inside a peat bog - each time, someone miraculously found it, tucking it into their pocket to open locks all over the world.  The skeleton key was created years ago, it is thought by the snakelings, an act that startled the magical world into taking the strange, reptilian creatures seriously.
KEW_KEY_SID=old iron key
KEW_KEY_USAGE_SID=an old iron key
KEW_KEY_CODEX_SID=A pitted key, once gold-coated.  It opens the locks inside of Kew's house in Isen Dun.
BOATHOUSE_KEY_SID=boathouse key
BOATHOUSE_KEY_USAGE_SID=a boathouse key
BOATHOUSE_KEY_CODEX_SID=A small, heavy key, used to unlock the door to the boathouse in Isen Dun.
WINTERSEA_TOMBS_KEY_SID=dusty key
WINTERSEA_TOMBS_KEY_USAGE_SID=a dusty key
WINTERSEA_TOMBS_KEY_CODEX_SID=A rough stone key to the tombs buried deep under Wintersea Keep.
WINTERSEA_TOWER_KEY_SID=pitted key
WINTERSEA_TOWER_KEY_USAGE_SID=a pitted key
WINTERSEA_TOWER_KEY_CODEX_SID=A key to the tower at Wintersea.  The handle resembles a streaking comet.
WYRMESWRAEC_GATE_KEY_SID=dwarven key
WYRMESWRAEC_GATE_KEY_USAGE_SID=a dwarven key
WYRMESWRAEC_GATE_KEY_CODEX_SID=An old steel key to the wasted Dwarven city now known as Wyrmeswraec.
EKA_KEY_SID=faerie key
EKA_KEY_USAGE_SID=a faerie key
EKA_KEY_CODEX_SID=A key of great magical power, made by the fair folk before they disappeared from this world.
OKHOA_KEY_SID=strangely heavy key
OKHOA_KEY_USAGE_SID=a strangely heavy key
OKHOA_KEY_CODEX_SID=A massive key suitable for an ogre, locking the great door to Okhoa's room in the high tower of sorcery.
CARCASSIA_FOOTMAN_KEY_SID=simple iron key
CARCASSIA_FOOTMAN_KEY_USAGE_SID=a simple iron key
CARCASSIA_FOOTMAN_KEY_CODEX_SID=A small iron key to the praetor's house in Carcassia, given by the footman.
CARCASSIA_COALMAN_KEY_SID=bronze key
CARCASSIA_COALMAN_KEY_USAGE_SID=a bronze key
CARCASSIA_COALMAN_KEY_CODEX_SID=A bronze key for use in the praetor's house in Carcassia, given by the coalman.
CARCASSIA_SCULLERYMAID_KEY_SID=heavy, worn key
CARCASSIA_SCULLERYMAID_KEY_USAGE_SID=a heavy, worn key
CARCASSIA_SCULLERYMAID_KEY_CODEX_SID=A heavy, worn key for use in the praetor's house in Carcassia, given by the scullerymaid.
CARCASSIA_COOK_KEY_SID=silver-plated key
CARCASSIA_COOK_KEY_USAGE_SID=a silver-plated key
CARCASSIA_COOK_KEY_CODEX_SID=A silver-plated key for use in the praetor's house in Carcassia, given by the cook.
CARCASSIA_PRAETOR_KEY_SID=gold-plated key
CARCASSIA_PRAETOR_KEY_USAGE_SID=a gold-plated key
CARCASSIA_PRAETOR_KEY_CODEX_SID=A gold-plated key for use in the praetor's house in Carcassia, given by the praetor's private secretary.
CASINO_KEY_SID=sparkly key
CASINO_KEY_USAGE_SID=a sparkly key
CASINO_KEY_CODEX_SID=A gaudy, sparkly key to the vaults in the Carcassian casino.
CARCASSIA_ARMORY_KEY_SID=imperial key
CARCASSIA_ARMORY_KEY_USAGE_SID=an imperial key
CARCASSIA_ARMORY_KEY_CODEX_SID=A key bearing the imperial emblem, used to unlock the armory supplying the officers of the Carcassian army.
TEMPLATE_KEY_SID=heavy key
TEMPLATE_KEY_USAGE_SID=a heavy key
TEMPLATE_KEY_CODEX_SID=A non-descript, heavy key.  It is uncertain what the key is for.
CRYPT_KEY_SID=stone key
CRYPT_KEY_USAGE_SID=a stone key
CRYPT_KEY_CODEX_SID=A key to the heart of an ancient crypt.
RUNE_STONE_SID=rune stone
RUNE_STONE_USAGE_SID=a rune stone
RUNE_STONE_CODEX_SID=A rune stone bearing the rune "Y".  It matches with a similar stone set at the base of Zaeda's Tower.
SUN_GEM_SID=Sun Gem
SUN_GEM_USAGE_SID=the Sun Gem
SUN_GEM_CODEX_SID=Something akin to magici, the Sun Gem is concentrated, crystallized magic, but is made of a purer, more powerful magic.  It takes its name from its itensity - warm in the hand, it radiates bright as the sun, and the same colour as well.  The Sun Gem's energy could surely be harnessed for a number of uses, whether providing a constant source of heat to crops, helping fire a forge hotter than conventional means, or another use entirely.
HEART_HEAVEN_SID=Heart of Heaven
HEART_HEAVEN_USAGE_SID=the Heart of Heaven
HEART_HEAVEN_CODEX_SID=Translucent.  A strange shimmer, as if starlight.  Cold, cold, the skin freezing, unsafe to touch.  Something from the heavens; something from the Nine.  A celestial gem?  Something lost by them, sought.  Hidden here on this earth.  Blessed by magic.  Beyond their vision.
HEART_WORLD_SID=Heart of the World
HEART_WORLD_USAGE_SID=the Heart of the World
HEART_WORLD_CODEX_SID=Diamond, clear and perfect.  Formed at the centre of the world, at indescribable pressure.  Granted by the divine to a princess, the most lovely of all, whose name is not known, never known again.  On her passing, sought out.  But stolen.  Unfound.
HEART_WORLD_BEYOND_SID=Heart of the World Beyond
HEART_WORLD_BEYOND_USAGE_SID=the Heart of the World Beyond
HEART_WORLD_BEYOND_CODEX_SID=Black and veined.  Not onyx, nor opal.  Said to be plucked from the underworld, a stone taken, something that should not be.  Held to the air, it whispers; to the ear it screams.  A dark thing.  Precious and black.
COSMOS_STONE_SID=Cosmos Stone
COSMOS_STONE_USAGE_SID=the Cosmos Stone
COSMOS_STONE_CODEX_SID=A kind of counterpart to the Sun Gem, the Cosmos Stone represents all the matter of the universe.  Contained within are all the metals and alloys: tin and iron, steel and bronze, and other substances for which the races have no name.  Such a thing is not of this earth.  It represents a small fragment of the body of a creature that came streaking from the heavens, a writhing comet, a thing that levelled mountains on impact then rose to devour all living things.
BLACK_ORB_SID=Black Orb
BLACK_ORB_USAGE_SID=the Black Orb
BLACK_ORB_CODEX_SID=Belonging to the dwarves for many thousands of years, the Black Orb was the centrepiece of the ruined temple at Wyrmeswraec.  The dwarves have long had a culture of mysticism, and dwarven mystics would come consult the orb, which when touched roils grey-black, and is said to impart visions.  The dwarves claim only to have discovered it, not created it, saying that it was found perfectly formed in a pocket deep below the earth.  It is a thing of deep intelligence and chaos, whispering to nearby people others' secrets, gleefully telling the things that they would rather keep unsaid.
FISHING_ROD_SID=fishing rod
FISHING_ROD_USAGE_SID=a fishing rod
FISHING_ROD_CODEX_SID=Though the great fishing ships will use series of nets to catch fish, the simple fishing rod is what most individual fishers use.  The longer the rod, the further the line can be cast, and with a simple reel, the fish can be easily drawn to the boat.  The simplest fishing rods are made from a single, flexible rod of wood, but fancier varieties feature multi-piece rods, for easy repair and replacement.
MOLD_AND_DECKLE_SID=mold and deckle
MOLD_AND_DECKLE_USAGE_SID=a mold and deckle
MOLD_AND_DECKLE_CODEX_SID=The means by which small amounts of paper are made, the mold and deckle is dipped into a slurry of water and paper fibres.  The water then drains off, and the deckle frame is removed, revealing a damp, rough page.  Once this fully dries, the actual sheet of paper is created.  This process is time consuming, but for some, paper-making is an art, and artisans can influence the final product by including coloured paper in the slurry, by carefully including things like dried flower petals, or otherwise in a number of other ways.
LUTE_SID=lute
LUTE_USAGE_SID=a lute
LUTE_CODEX_SID=Lutes are plucked string instruments, played either with fingers, or some sort of plectrum.  They are typically fretted, the frets being either metal or tied gut, and the instrument has a light, delicate sound.  They require a great deal of time to make, needing to first season the wood, then assemble the shell, and then with excruciating care create the intricate rosettes around the soundholes.  Because of this, the lute is usually an upper-class instrument, played by the songs and daughters of wealthy families, though there is an entire class of peasant lutes, made quickly and from cheap wood such as pine or oak, and while not nearly as beautiful, are are said to sound almost as good.
FIFE_SID=fife
FIFE_USAGE_SID=a fife
FIFE_CODEX_SID=A small, transverse flute, the fife has a pitch somewhere between a flute and a piccolo.  It has a limited range, but is popular among military groups, who employ drummers and fifers to help their armies march in formation properly.  Outside of the military applications, it is particularly popular in rural areas, as the instrument itself can be made completely out of many different types of wood, and does not require any specialized metalworking tools.
DULCIMER_SID=dulcimer
DULCIMER_USAGE_SID=a dulcimer
DULCIMER_CODEX_SID=A simple stringed instrument, the dulcimer is played by using a pair of hammers to strike metal strings.  It is like a less powerful, portable version of the piano, and features in a number of ancient poems in which the heroes were said to use dulcimers to tame beasts, or summon down the divine.  The dulcimer is usually laid flat on a table of some kind to play, though wandering minstrels have devised a series of straps to allow them to play the dulcimer either flat against the body, or jutting out in front of them.
SACKBUT_SID=sackbut
SACKBUT_USAGE_SID=a sackbut
SACKBUT_CODEX_SID=A brass instrument with a cylindrical bore and a telescoping slide, the sackbut has a sweet, tenor sound.  The ability to play chromatically gives it a great deal of versatility, and the slide allows quick, minute changes to the pitch.  Capable of playing from a whispering piano to a booming fortissimo, the sackbut is equally at home announcing the presence of kings and queens, accompanying voices in church choirs, or simply playing alongside a singer in a folk tune.
FIDDLE_SID=fiddle
FIDDLE_USAGE_SID=a fiddle
FIDDLE_CODEX_SID=The colloquial term for a violin, a fiddle is the highest of the bowed string family, which includes violas, viols and cellos, and the massive double bass.  Rosin is applied to the bow before playing, and this allows the horse-hair to grip the strings and resonate.  In terms of range, the fiddle is pitched a fifth above the viola, sharing three strings in common, but while the viola's tone is rich and warm, the fiddle's is bright and clear, and when skillfully played in its highest range, brilliant.  Fiddle-playing has a rich history in many cultures, from the shanties and reels played by sailors, to the dark music of the caravan-dwellers, to the jigs and dances played at wedding receptions around the world.
HORN_SID=horn
HORN_USAGE_SID=a horn
HORN_CODEX_SID=While some horns are still made from hollowed-out animal horns, most modern horns are made of brass or similar metals.  A small tube that tapers out to a wide bell, the horn is played by buzzing the lips over the mouthpiece.  This produces the basic sound, and then the different notes of the overtone series are hit by making minor adjustments to the embouchure.  Natural horns, those without keys, can only play the notes of the overtone series, though skilled players can use their lips, in conjunction with their bell-hand, to sharpen or flatten notes skillfully to achieve a wider range of notes.
GIN_SID=dram of gin
GIN_USAGE_SID=a dram of gin
GIN_CODEX_SID=Gin is grain alcohol infused with distilled juniper.  Other herbs and berries may be present - coriander and orange, cherry blossoms, cardamom, anise.  It can be enjoyed neat, but is often blended into cocktails.  Gin generally is not aged as long as other spirits, particularly whisky, and as such it is relatively cheap and easy to produce.  Good gin is also sought after, being a traditional drink of the upper classes, and over the years many peasants, making the journey to larger towns and cities, have found success selling gin from family recipes honed over many generations.
MEAD_SID=dram of mead
MEAD_USAGE_SID=a dram of mead
MEAD_CODEX_SID=Mead is one of the simplest forms of alcohol to make.  It is simply water, honey, and yeast.  It is a traditional drink in many parts of the world, and of many races; in particular, it is enjoyed by the wood elves, who ferment it at the end of winter, taking advantage of the cool temperatures to avoid off-flavours during fermentation.  They then enjoy it all through the summer months, chilling the bottles in shallow streams, the near-freezing temperatures keeping the drink delightfully crisp and cold.
WHISKY_SID=dram of whisky
WHISKY_USAGE_SID=a dram of whisky
WHISKY_CODEX_SID=Alcohol made from distilled grain, whisky can be enjoyed white or barrel-aged, neat or as part of a cocktail.  In some remote areas, whisky distillation has become a secretive art, passed down as a collective knowledge through the villages and towns, who make and age their whiskeys for years and years before sending them on ships to the outside world.  Many of these villages, perched on remote islands and dependent on good weather, exist in a state of near-extinction; and sometimes, after a particularly great year, ships have come to buy the next year's supply only to find the last few inhabitants gone, the buildings empty, the barrels nowhere to be found.
GNOMISH_STOUT_SID=pint of gnomish stout
GNOMISH_STOUT_USAGE_SID=a pint of gnomish stout
GNOMISH_STOUT_CODEX_SID=Gnomes tend to live on and under mountainsides.  They grow grain where they can, at lower altitudes and closer to the sea.  Once the harvest is brought in, after most of the grain has been milled to flour, or kept in storage, the remainder is used to make stout.  Made with oats and roasted barley, and a generous addition of hops, gnomish stout is thick, hearty, and bitter.  Kept in casks, it is usually enjoyed within a few months of brewing, and extra-hoppy, higher alcohol varieties, thought to be more suitable for long sea-voyages, are exported from their towns to the wider world.
FORTIFIED_DWARVEN_WINE_SID=flask of fortified dwarven wine
FORTIFIED_DWARVEN_WINE_USAGE_SID=a flask of fortified dwarven wine
FORTIFIED_DWARVEN_WINE_CODEX_SID=Dwarves don't drink a lot of wine, preferring beer and whisky, but when they do, it's usually fortified.  Just before the fermentation is done, a generous amount of brandy is added, halting fermentation, and creating a strong drink that still keeps some characteristics of the actual grape.  Dwarven grapes, though, are a touch sour, and their fortified wine is strong, but keeps a bit of the pucker of their small, cold-weather grapes.
ELVEN_BRANDY_SID=flask of elven brandy
ELVEN_BRANDY_USAGE_SID=a flask of elven brandy
ELVEN_BRANDY_CODEX_SID=Around the great elven forests, one can sometimes see long, thin vineyards, sloping from the forest's edge down to the sea.  These are used to create elven wine and, after a particularly good harvest, elven brandy as well.  The finished wines are distilled into brandy, then immediately oaked in small barrels to age for years in cool, secluded sections of the forest.  The end result is often described as magical, but the wood elves will say that there's nothing arcane about the process, simply the application of methods refined and perfected over tens of thousands of years.
GOBLIN_MOONSHINE_SID=jar of goblin moonshine
GOBLIN_MOONSHINE_USAGE_SID=a jar of goblin moonshine
GOBLIN_MOONSHINE_CODEX_SID=Goblin moonshine is a vile hooch brewed by goblins with whatever is available.  Usually a basic corn whisky distilled in ramshackle stills, the finished product is hazy, faintly yellow-brown, and tastes of grease, blood, and sweat.  Because of this, goblins doctor it with whatever is at hand: molasses, cane sugar, and bitters are all popular, as are chunks of raw meat, dirt, sawdust, and the bird they found out behind the still.  The end result is drinkable, maybe.  But the point is less the taste, and more the hundred thirty proof.
HEALING_POTION_SID=healing potion
UNID_HEALING_POTION_SID=azure potion
HEALING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a healing potion
UNID_HEALING_POTION_USAGE_SID=an azure potion
HEALING_POTION_CODEX_SID=A kind of insurance policy, beloved by explorers everywhere, healing potions act as a faster, better version of the body's natural processes.  A good swig can close wounds, remove scars, settle fevers; and drinking down an entire potion can mend bones, clear concussions, even reattach limbs.  Those travelling deep into dungeons are well-advised to carry a few of these, or be very sure of their standing with the Nine.
ANTIDOTE_POTION_SID=antidote
UNID_ANTIDOTE_POTION_SID=swirling potion
ANTIDOTE_POTION_USAGE_SID=an antidote
UNID_ANTIDOTE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a swirling potion
ANTIDOTE_POTION_CODEX_SID=It's not the wound that'll kill you, it's said, but what's in it.  And the world is full of crawling, poisonous things, snakes and spiders and worse, slithering and scuttling out of the shadows to take their chance on anything that moves.  Antidote potions are a combination of herbs and magic, which when brewed thicken up to a syrup that can be ingested or poured into a wound.  Being caught without one of these can be fatal - a mile or more beneath the earth, the climb up may prove fatal, the exertion amplifying the power of the poison, the steps of so many dungeons littered with the twisted, agonized bodies of the dead.
AMUT_POTION_SID=muteness tonic
UNID_AMUT_POTION_SID=alabaster potion
AMUT_POTION_USAGE_SID=a muteness tonic
UNID_AMUT_POTION_USAGE_SID=an alabaster potion
AMUT_POTION_CODEX_SID=All magic requires some sort of speech.  Arcane magic requires speaking the old tongues fluently, while mystics hum strange atonal melodies, and priests call out to the divine.  Even the primordial magic of witchlings requires sound, often simply grunting or screaming.  So to a spellcaster, silence is death, and the ability to remove muteness absolutely vital.  Muteness tonics are created by infusing alcohols with the berry of the red weeper, a plant whose leaves touch the ground and that creates bright crimson berries in the fall.  The resulting drink coats the vocal cords, repairing them, and allowing the drinker to freely speak again.
SPEED_POTION_SID=speed potion
UNID_SPEED_POTION_SID=glowing potion
SPEED_POTION_USAGE_SID=a speed potion
UNID_SPEED_POTION_USAGE_SID=a glowing potion
SPEED_POTION_CODEX_SID=Running away can save your life, but sometimes you have to run away faster, or in the worst cases, fasterer.  A speed potion will help with this.  Boosting the body's natural metabolic processes, the consumption of these has been described as the combination of doing a large amount of narcotics and drinking several gallons of tea.  The consumer finds themself able to move twice as quickly as before, and against all but the fastest creatures of the world, this should be enough to get away, and quickly.
UNSTONING_POTION_SID=unstoning potion
UNID_UNSTONING_POTION_SID=sapphire potion
UNSTONING_POTION_USAGE_SID=an unstoning potion
UNID_UNSTONING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a sapphire potion
UNSTONING_POTION_CODEX_SID=The primordial magics that run through the universe are said to contain the essence of entropy, and their effect on the body is undeniable.  Unresisted, shadow damage causes the limbs to slowly stiffen.  From there, the skin becomes pale and grey, the tissue hard and tough, and over a short period of time, the body itself becomes petrified.  The servants of the black god are blessed by his touch, and have the ability to cause this petrification.  Those who would go out in the world would be advised to bring an unstoning potion, a tonic brewed from certain wildflowers and blessed by a priest of any of the other eight deities.
UNBINDING_POTION_SID=unbinding potion
UNID_UNBINDING_POTION_SID=slimy potion
UNBINDING_POTION_USAGE_SID=an unbinding potion
UNID_UNBINDING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a slimy potion
UNBINDING_POTION_CODEX_SID=To be spellbound is less feared than to be paralyzed, because action is still possible, even if movement is not.  Still, it is not that much better, and the inability to run away can be certain death in many situations.  A cure-all containing the essence of arcane magic can help with this condition, releasing the magical bonds that bind person to place.  Such potions are difficult to brew, requiring the magic of a tower-trained wizard, and so have a certain rarity that makes them coveted all the more.
SUSTENANCE_POTION_SID=sustenance potion
UNID_SUSTENANCE_POTION_SID=emerald potion
SUSTENANCE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a sustenance potion
UNID_SUSTENANCE_POTION_USAGE_SID=an emerald potion
SUSTENANCE_POTION_CODEX_SID=Most potions are magic, but there's nothing particularly special about sustenance potions.  The thick, glutinous drinks are little more extremely-high-calorie drinks.  Using some kind of non-alcoholic malt beverage as a base, they include animal fats, pulverized nuts, berries, and other substances.  The result is disgusting and barely drinkable, but which contains one's breakfast, lunch, and supper within a single drink.
RESTORATIVE_POTION_SID=restorative potion
UNID_RESTORATIVE_POTION_SID=murky potion
RESTORATIVE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a restorative potion
UNID_RESTORATIVE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a murky potion
RESTORATIVE_POTION_CODEX_SID=The slow death of wasting diseases is a fearful thing.  The strength drops away; the mind slows, as if in a cloud; and reflexes give, causing stumbling and fumbling.  To repair your facilities, drink a restorative potion.  This will grant immediate relief of the draining conditions, restoring health and vitality immediately.  The middle-aged nobility believes that drinking these while healthy increases sex drive; however, these are typically taken before a furtive night with the mistress, and it would seem that the bigger aphrodesiac is the risk and excitement of making love to someone new.
UNBLINDING_POTION_SID=unblinding potion
UNID_UNBLINDING_POTION_SID=blazing potion
UNBLINDING_POTION_USAGE_SID=an unblinding potion
UNID_UNBLINDING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a blazing potion
UNBLINDING_POTION_CODEX_SID=There is little more terrifying than sudden and total blindness.  For the sighted to be blinded is to be suddenly thrust into a foreign world, devoid of the sense around which we build our worlds.  And for this to happen when suddenly in danger requires quick thinking, the ability to retrace one's steps out of a dungeon in pitch blackness, mindful of traps and creatures avoided along the way.  Fortunately, there is an answer: unblinding potions, brewed by many hedge witches, will restore the sense of sight, though caution should be taken, as many of these potions are doctored with love-herbs so that the drinker will fall in love with the hedge witch upon return.
FLYING_POTION_SID=flying potion
UNID_FLYING_POTION_SID=ruby potion
FLYING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a flying potion
UNID_FLYING_POTION_USAGE_SID=a ruby potion
FLYING_POTION_CODEX_SID=Most of the races have tried to imitate flight at some point - the closest that anyone's come to this is the goblins, whose ornithopters allow flight in favourable wind conditions when launched off of mountainsides.  But that's natural flight: unnatural flight can be achieved by drinking a tincture made from powdered griffin bones.  This doesn't cause flight so much as float, the drinker levitating above the ground, and able to step about on solid air.
GAIN_ATTRIBUTES_POTION_SID=gain attributes potion
UNID_GAIN_ATTRIBUTES_POTION_SID=gluey potion
GAIN_ATTRIBUTES_POTION_USAGE_SID=a gain attributes potion
UNID_GAIN_ATTRIBUTES_POTION_USAGE_SID=a gluey potion
GAIN_ATTRIBUTES_POTION_CODEX_SID=Created from deep magics, gain attributes potions can make the drinker, smarter, stronger, or more attractive; or, if they are particularly lucky, all at once.  These drinks can push past the boundaries of physiology, creating elves stronger than titans, goblins swifter than leopards, and it is a long-standing debate among classicists whether the ancient heroes, the superhuman ones, were things of myth or if they had simply knocked back an entire cauldron of the stuff.
FIRE_POTION_SID=fire potion
UNID_FIRE_POTION_SID=radiant potion
FIRE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a fire potion
UNID_FIRE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a radiant potion
FIRE_POTION_CODEX_SID=Created by some sort of prankster - goblin?  fae? - and left in treasure chests throughout the world, fire potions are an unhappy discovery by unwary adventurers.  A combination of incredibly hot peppers and powerful laxatives, it causes intense gastrointestinal distress, leading to explosive diarrhea, dehydration, and even death.  The naturally spicy smell is masked by sweeteners, usually a large amount of sugar, and the difference between a fire potion and fruit juice can often only be discovered by taste.
ETHER_POTION_SID=potion of ether
UNID_ETHER_POTION_SID=magenta potion
ETHER_POTION_USAGE_SID=a potion of ether
UNID_ETHER_POTION_USAGE_SID=a magenta potion
ETHER_POTION_CODEX_SID=Made of the sparkling waters from a fairy spring, ether potions allow the drinker to restore some portion of their magical power.  They are rare, as fairy springs themselves remain only in the most remote parts of the world.  But the water is prized by wandering wizards and witchlings, whose very lives depend on having the power to summon up their magics quickly and repeatedly.
FRUIT_JUICE_POTION_SID=potion of juice
UNID_FRUIT_JUICE_POTION_SID=crimson potion
FRUIT_JUICE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a potion of juice
UNID_FRUIT_JUICE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a crimson potion
FRUIT_JUICE_POTION_CODEX_SID=Nothing more than a beaker of some kind of fruit juice, often grape or pomegranate.  Dungeons might not be fun, but that doesn't mean that hydration can't be!
RAGE_POTION_SID=potion of rage
UNID_RAGE_POTION_SID=cerulean potion
RAGE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a potion of rage
UNID_RAGE_POTION_USAGE_SID=a cerulean potion
RAGE_POTION_CODEX_SID=Potions of rage are basically drug cocktails.  Containing powerful cathinones, they reduce the drinker's inhibitions, leading to erratic behaviour, rage, and hallucinations.  For reasons not fully understood, they also increase the ability to take damage, and so these concoctions are often taken moments before a battle by the unlucky vanguard, who trust in the strength- and endurance-increasing effects to guide them through to the end, whether victory or the world beyond.
TEMPLATE_SCROLL_SID=scroll of %s
TEMPLATE_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of %s
BLANK_SCROLL_SID=blank scroll
BLANK_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a blank scroll
BLANK_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=A long piece of paper, parchment, or some other material suitable for writing, blank scrolls are capable of holding everything from laws and proclamations, to works of literature, to magic spells.  The latter tend to be the usage most commonly found in the wild, the scrolls tucked away by people unknown, perhaps as part of a hoard, or for later use.  But magical scrolls have a major problem: the single, unbroken sheet, written in the common tongue, gives under the pressure when invoked, immediately disappearing.  Spellbooks are more popular for long-term storage, but these tend to be written in Runic, and are unintelligible by everyone except for spellcasters with the training to read that ancient script.
IDENTIFY_SCROLL_SID=scroll of identify
UNID_IDENTIFY_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "DEO ET PATRIAE"
IDENTIFY_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of identify
UNID_IDENTIFY_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "DEO ET PATRIAE"
IDENTIFY_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Identification scrolls are a godsend out in the wild.  The brave identify their items by usage, but then, so do the dead.  Prudent adventurers bring with them a cache of identification scrolls.  These reveal the true use of things, and in a moment of danger, can end up being the difference between life and death.
MAPPING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of mapping
UNID_MAPPING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "QUI AUDET ADIPISCITUR"
MAPPING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of mapping
UNID_MAPPING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "QUI AUDET ADIPISCITUR"
MAPPING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Some say that dungeons are just a collection of rooms and hallways, but this is far from the truth.  The deeper one goes, the more dangerous the inky darkness that spreads beyond the vision.  In there lurk things of poison, cosmic horrors, angelic beings; and being able to guess where the next twist or turn might lead can mean life or death.  Mapping scrolls help with this - they place the unseen into memory, albeit hazy and half-remembered, allowing an adventurer to see places yet unvisited.
RECHARGING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of recharging
UNID_RECHARGING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "AB EXTRA"
RECHARGING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of recharging
UNID_RECHARGING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "AB EXTRA"
RECHARGING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Most people who have survived the dark places of the world have some sort of cache of wands.  But these do not last forever.  Each one contains a small amount of power, and once used up, it reverts back to a common piece of wood.  Recharging scrolls contain in their speaking the essence of pure, uncategorized magic.  They work by refilling a wand with the power it originally had.  This is the key point of the process for most, but some sages and philosophers have found deeper meaning in this, musing that magic is never truly gone, just inert, and that the deep magics described in the few unknowingly old texts of the old fair folk might one day, somehow, return.
ENCHANTING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of enchanting
UNID_ENCHANTING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "VERITAS OMNIA VINCIT"
ENCHANTING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of enchanting
UNID_ENCHANTING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "VERITAS OMNIA VINCIT"
ENCHANTING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Magical items don't just happen by accident.  Hedge wizards have long known of a way of capturing the abstract notion of improvement; written out on a scroll, it can enhance an item currently held in the reader's focus.  Food becomes more nutritious; weapons stronger, sharper; armour harder, or more resistant.  Everything, though, has its limits, and eventually the improvements slow, finally ceasing.  Artifacts, too, are a known issue: these seem to be frozen in a particular moment in time, and cannot be improved any further.
CLEANSING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of cleansing
UNID_CLEANSING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "MORITURI TE SALUTANT"
CLEANSING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of cleansing
UNID_CLEANSING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "MORITURI TE SALUTANT"
CLEANSING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Slimes split.  Bugs breed.  There are all kinds of situations that can get out of hand quickly, and so-called spontaneous reproduction, or simply breeding, is one of them.  Deep below the ancient deserts there are tombs of the old kings, filled with great treasures to accompany them into the afterlife.  To deter thieves, breeding bugs were introduced - on danger, these split suddenly and exponentially, overwhelming and eating the intruder, leaving nothing but their armour and bits of bone.  There is a word to stop this, a single word from the old Runic language.  Transliterated into the common tongue, much of the magic is lost, but it can still prove useful, putting a sudden end to the reproductive capabilities of any creatures nearby.
UNCURSING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of uncursing
UNID_UNCURSING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "BELLA HORRIDA BELLA"
UNCURSING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of uncursing
UNID_UNCURSING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "BELLA HORRIDA BELLA"
UNCURSING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Blessings are divine - curses are human.  Or at least magical, representing the bending of luck consistently in the wrong direction.  It follows that if someone is the luckiest person in the world, someone must be the unluckiest, but a curse can make this into a repeatable outcome, person after person, over and over and over.  When the curse is removed, so is a black pall; a tautness, a tension is removed, and everything feels bright and new.
BLESS_SCROLL_SID=scroll of blessing
UNID_BLESS_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "CONSUMMATUM EST"
BLESS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of blessing
UNID_BLESS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "CONSUMMATUM EST"
BLESS_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Items carrying divine blessing are known to have a strange kind of luck associated with them.  The exact effects of this are not fully understood.  Superstitious travellers ascribe everything from lucky blows to finding an extra cake in their bags to an object's blessing.  Priests with a taste for money can make a tidy profit selling scrolls of blessing, their efforts earning enough to repair their church, donate to the wider parish, or simply to line their own pockets.
DETECT_TRAPS_SCROLL_SID=scroll of trap detection
UNID_DETECT_TRAPS_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "AMOR OMNIBUS IDEM"
DETECT_TRAPS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of trap detection
UNID_DETECT_TRAPS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "AMOR OMNIBUS IDEM"
DETECT_TRAPS_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Thieves and rogues have a knack for finding traps - those who set them can also find their tell-tale signs, from loose mortar in the flagstones on the floor, to the tiny but detectable drip of blackwater from the ceiling overhead.  Those without such skills turn to scrolls.  As the spell is spoken, the paper falls away - and then, the glowing text breaks apart, scattering to fly like birds and reveal the traps nearby.
SUMMON_MONSTERS_SCROLL_SID=scroll of monster summoning
UNID_SUMMON_MONSTERS_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "CARPE DIEM"
SUMMON_MONSTERS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of monster summoning
UNID_SUMMON_MONSTERS_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "CARPE DIEM"
SUMMON_MONSTERS_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Years ago, the mad wizard Fredwick took a leaky rowboat to a tiny island north of the Forest of Yew.  Once there, he retreated into a cave, and for the next ten years devoted himself to his life's work: creating scrolls to summon monsters.  Passing sailors talked of a man who raved about bringing the dragons back again, and who offered them each a kilo of ivory pieces if they would just take his scrolls and hide them throughout the world.
REPEL_SCROLL_SID=scroll of repelling
UNID_REPEL_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "DIFFUGERE NIVES"
REPEL_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of repelling
UNID_REPEL_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "DIFFUGERE NIVES"
REPEL_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=Space is life.  When staring down a room of ogres or goblins, having the space to act can give enough time to cast a powerful spell or move toward an exit.  There is a scroll for this, and among those not harbouring a deathwish, it is immensely popular.  To repel enemies outward, just a few words are needed, and with a sweep of the arm, hostile creatures are cast aside, disoriented for just a moment before they close in again.
WARPING_SCROLL_SID=scroll of warping
UNID_WARPING_SCROLL_SID=scroll labelled "IN NOVA FERT ANIMUS"
WARPING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll of warping
UNID_WARPING_SCROLL_USAGE_SID=a scroll labelled "IN NOVA FERT ANIMUS"
WARPING_SCROLL_CODEX_SID=It's said that if you spend a lifetime exploring dungeons, at least half of that will be spent on stairs.  The winding, broken steps that lead in and out of the depths are rough and awkward, sometimes cut from stone, sometimes dug from the earth itself.  Those with less patience have found an old cantrip particularly helpful - warping, originally used to bring things closer to the caster, can be repurposed to bring the caster closer to other things.  It is a dense spell.  When recited, it causes the fabric of space to bend and warp.  The caster focuses on the world above, takes a single step, and arrives outside dungeon, squinting at the sudden sunlight, disoriented and sick from the strange movement, and back in the world above.
TEMPLATE_WAND_SID=wand of %s
TEMPLATE_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of %s
TELEPORT_WAND_SID=wand of teleport
UNID_TELEPORT_WAND_SID=gnarled wand
TELEPORT_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of teleport
UNID_TELEPORT_WAND_USAGE_SID=a gnarled wand
TELEPORT_WAND_CODEX_SID=Combat is victory or death.  Well, that is, if you choose to participate.  Knowing when to fight is more important than knowing how to fight, and having a wand of teleport allows one to pick and choose their encounters.  Full of powerful magics, the wands bend space for a moment, placing the evoker elsewhere.  But this process cannot be controlled, and so such wands are used only as a last resource, as while they may help escape a certain situation, they might end up creating something far worse.
FROST_WAND_SID=wand of frost
UNID_FROST_WAND_SID=yew wand
FROST_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of frost
UNID_FROST_WAND_USAGE_SID=a yew wand
FROST_WAND_CODEX_SID=With a word, wands of frost release a stream of sleet and snow towards the target.  Beyond the initial system shock this gives, a kind of slowness can set in.  Those weathering extreme cold find their mind working slower, their limbs stiff and numb, and find movement difficult.  Wands of frost are often employed for exactly this purpose, slowing down their targets and allowing the evoker to take control of the tactics of the combat.
FLAME_WAND_SID=wand of flames
UNID_FLAME_WAND_SID=maple wand
FLAME_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of flames
UNID_FLAME_WAND_USAGE_SID=a maple wand
FLAME_WAND_CODEX_SID=One of the first wands made by most wizards is a wand of flame.  This isn't because it's in the curriculum (it's not), or because it's recommended by the masters (it definitely isn't), but is largely because people become wizards to do cool, impressive stuff, and there isn't much that's better than holding a literal flamethrower and mowing down everything in your way.
ACID_WAND_SID=wand of acid
UNID_ACID_WAND_SID=aspen wand
ACID_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of acid
UNID_ACID_WAND_USAGE_SID=an aspen wand
ACID_WAND_CODEX_SID=Years ago, a new wizard of the high tower, Digby, a former explorer himself, found that he could go no further in a dungeon - a massive great snake barred the way, and the spells he knew would not be enough.  Tramping back to the tower, he drank with the other students that night, and six pints in, someone suggested, "so whaddif you sprayed it with aciddd a lot of acid omg".  The next day, he tramped back down, and released a stream of acid from a wand.  The snake was enraged, and ate him.  Eventually the wand itself was recovered, and everyone agreed the idea was sound, even if the actual outcome left something to be desired for Digby himself.
POISON_WAND_SID=wand of poison
UNID_POISON_WAND_SID=rosewood wand
POISON_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of poison
UNID_POISON_WAND_USAGE_SID=a rosewood wand
POISON_WAND_CODEX_SID=Poison is a powerful thing.  The most deadly snakes in the world barely break the skin, but their poison courses through the body, weakening the victim.  Some poisons cause blood clots, which can eventually kill the victim; others kill tissue, requiring the amputation of limbs to halt further spread.  Wands of poison are carried because they represent an effective way of slowly killing things that are too dangerous to walk up to and hit with a sword.
SHADOW_WAND_SID=wand of shadow
UNID_SHADOW_WAND_SID=cypress wand
SHADOW_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of shadow
UNID_SHADOW_WAND_USAGE_SID=a cypress wand
SHADOW_WAND_CODEX_SID=Wands of shadow hold the dark matter of the universe, the primordial power harnessed by witchlings and servants of the black god Sceadugenga.  This inky, blue-black magic hits with the force of an explosion, but contains no heat; and once in the system, it slowly corrupts the victim, causing their limbs to stiffen, slowing their ability to move, and eventually killing them, leaving the body as a lifeless and writhing statue on the ground.
HOLY_WAND_SID=wand of wrath
UNID_HOLY_WAND_SID=willow wand
HOLY_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of wrath
UNID_HOLY_WAND_USAGE_SID=a willow wand
HOLY_WAND_CODEX_SID=Containing pure divine magic, wands of wrath are said to hold the breath of the divine.  Erupting in blinding white light, they can will the target out of existence - or for those who survive, leave them dumbstruck at the power and majesty of the heavens.  Those afflicted by this later tell of losing their voice altogether, and among those who would summon magics, the loss of voice is a portent of calamity and doom.
ARCANE_WAND_SID=wand of arcana
UNID_ARCANE_WAND_SID=elm wand
ARCANE_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of arcana
UNID_ARCANE_WAND_USAGE_SID=an elm wand
ARCANE_WAND_CODEX_SID=Containing pure arcane magic, wands of arcana release a beam of magical energy toward the target.  While the beam is powerful enough in and of itself, it can also cause the target to be spellbound, unable to move toward the evoker, and many creatures afflicted by this have found themselves pelted to death by a subsequent hail of arrows, throwing spears, or stones.
DRAGON_BREATH_WAND_SID=wand of dragon breath
UNID_DRAGON_BREATH_WAND_SID=driftwood wand
DRAGON_BREATH_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of dragon breath
UNID_DRAGON_BREATH_WAND_USAGE_SID=a driftwood wand
DRAGON_BREATH_WAND_CODEX_SID=Wands of dragon breath are coveted for their ability to let the evoker "play dragon".  Holding the wand out in front of them, they evoke their wand, breathe like a dragon (this part might not actually be necessary), and watch as a cone of flame like dragon breath comes rippling out of the wand.  These wands are quite rare, found only in the darkest depths and, ironically, within the stacks of a dragon's hoard itself.
LIGHTNING_WAND_SID=wand of lightning
UNID_LIGHTNING_WAND_SID=pine wand
LIGHTNING_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of lightning
UNID_LIGHTNING_WAND_USAGE_SID=a pine wand
LIGHTNING_WAND_CODEX_SID=Lightning is dangerous in confined quarters.  It bounces off walls, following angles of reflection, careening wildly - and those unlucky enough to be hit by such a thing can often find themselves paralyzed.  Paralysis often means death, and canny travellers have noted that you don't have to be able to kill something in a fair fight, just to be able to remove the possibility of a fair fight altogether.
FIREBALL_WAND_SID=wand of fireball
UNID_FIREBALL_WAND_SID=rowan wand
FIREBALL_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of fireball
UNID_FIREBALL_WAND_USAGE_SID=a rowan wand
FIREBALL_WAND_CODEX_SID=There is nothing more terrifying than being surrounded in combat, facing down attacks on all side, being at the mercy of a coordinated group who can slowly wear you down and kill you.  Wands of fireball were devised for such situations, releasing an outburst of flame in each direction, and helping the poor evoker improve their odds significantly.
VORPAL_BOLT_WAND_SID=wand of vorpal bolt
UNID_VORPAL_BOLT_WAND_SID=cedar wand
VORPAL_BOLT_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of vorpal bolt
UNID_VORPAL_BOLT_WAND_USAGE_SID=an cedar wand
VORPAL_BOLT_WAND_CODEX_SID=Vorpal bolts are strange magics, generally not powerful but leaned on gamblers and the needy.  Dealing out a small amount of damage, they nonetheless are able to occasionally cleave a victim in two.  Not so impressive against a goblin or a fork bug, but at least one lucky explorer has come back dragging a huge amount of dragon scale, with nothing but a few of these wands tucked within their belt.
DIGGING_WAND_SID=wand of digging
UNID_DIGGING_WAND_SID=arbutus wand
DIGGING_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of digging
UNID_DIGGING_WAND_USAGE_SID=an arbutus wand
DIGGING_WAND_CODEX_SID=Pick axes are great, but require a great deal of strength.  The lazy and the desperate turn to wands of digging, which not only break apart earth, but do so quickly.  Backing into a corner might not seem like the safest course of action deep in a dungeon, but many adventurers have done so to avoid being surrounded, backing into a nook of their own making to take on those that would kill them, one by one by one.
INFERNO_WAND_SID=wand of inferno
UNID_INFERNO_WAND_SID=ebony wand
INFERNO_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of inferno
UNID_INFERNO_WAND_USAGE_SID=an ebony wand
INFERNO_WAND_CODEX_SID=Containing magics that dwarf any known to the greatest wizards of the world, wands of inferno are a relic of a world that passed before the age of empires, the age of dragons, even the age of the fair folk, the giants, and the unlings.  Each invocation of the wand releases a torrent of flame akin to the reactions within stars, a massive, almost unquantifiable amount of energy incinerating everything in its path.
OSMOSIS_WAND_SID=wand of osmosis
UNID_OSMOSIS_WAND_SID=ash wand
OSMOSIS_WAND_USAGE_SID=a wand of osmosis
UNID_OSMOSIS_WAND_USAGE_SID=an ash wand
OSMOSIS_WAND_CODEX_SID=Wands of osmosis combine two deadly draining effects, releasing the physical and magical energy of the target, and granting them to the evoker.  This has obvious uses for spellcasters, but clever adventurers have realized that it can be just as useful to deny a caster the ability to loose deadly spells, even if the adventurer themself cannot make use of the extracted magical energy.
SCREEN_TITLE_KEYBINDINGS=Key Bindings (Default)

ISEN_DUN_CHRONICLE_SID=Isen Dun Chronicle
ISEN_DUN_CHRONICLE_USAGE_SID=the Isen Dun Chronicle
ISEN_DUN_CHRONICLE_TEXT_SID=[[texts/isendunchronicle_en.txt]]
ISEN_DUN_CHRONICLE_CODEX_SID=A text detailing the settlement of Isen Dun, from the year it was settled to the current day.  It represents only major events affecting the entire community - whole other years are lost, or summarized down to a few words, the entire history of this community contained within a few, sparse pages.
BOOK_OF_DAYS_SID=Book of Days
BOOK_OF_DAYS_USAGE_SID=the Book of Days
BOOK_OF_DAYS_TEXT_SID=[[texts/bookofdays_en.txt]]
BOOK_OF_DAYS_CODEX_SID=There are a number of events or celebrations throughout the year that, while not common to every culture, are observed by most.  These are written down in the Book of Days, a text originally created for the church of Celeste, but which, with appropriate removal of excessive religious references, has become a standard pamphlet distributed across the world.
THE_NINE_SID=Book of the Nine
THE_NINE_USAGE_SID=the Book of the Nine
THE_NINE_TEXT_SID=[[texts/thenine_en.txt]]
THE_NINE_CODEX_SID=The official religious explanation of how the divine beings of the universe came to be.  This text, bound into small, cheap paperbacks, can be found at churches and temples everywhere.  The more devout will also carry copies with them, to press into the hands of the unwary, who must endure being asked, again, if they have Celeste in their heart.
ON_ETERNALISM_SID=philosophical tract "On Eternalism"
ON_ETERNALISM_USAGE_SID=a philosophical tract "On Eternalism"
ON_ETERNALISM_TEXT_SID=[[texts/oneternalism_en.txt]]
ON_ETERNALISM_CODEX_SID=A philosophy written down by a long-since-assassinated Carcassian emperor, eternalism states that our lives are generally worthless and unremembered, and so we should live and treat people well.  It has gained popularity since its first publication, partially due to its association with the Carcassian emperors, but its popularity is mostly found in middle- and upper-class families who have time to care about things like philosophy - the vast majority of the world, ekeing out a precarious existence, doesn't particularly care.
ON_FAERIE_FRAGMENTS_SID=literary text "On the Faerie Fragments"
ON_FAERIE_FRAGMENTS_USAGE_SID=a literary text "On the Faerie Fragments"
ON_FAERIE_FRAGMENTS_TEXT_SID=[[texts/faeriefragment_en.txt]]
ON_FAERIE_FRAGMENTS_CODEX_SID=A text on the Cithriel fragments, some of the oldest known writing in the world, which is believed to have been written ten to thirty thousand years earlier (pinpointing an actual number is impossible) in the fair folk's hall of Cithriel, a massive underground hall that served as the hub for the fairy race.
TEL_AND_FLORIDEL_SID=Epic poem "Tel and Floridel"
TEL_AND_FLORIDEL_USAGE_SID=the epic poem "Tel and Floridel"
TEL_AND_FLORIDEL_TEXT_SID=[[texts/tel_and_floridel_en.txt]]
TEL_AND_FLORIDEL_CODEX_SID=A long poem written in Spenserian stanzas, the two halves unlinked, enjambment encouraged, slant-rhymes allowed.  It tells the story of Tel, a prince of the old fair folk, and his lover, Floridel, and it's fair to say that whoever wrote this clearly had an awful lot of time on their hands.
STONEHEIM_HISTORY_SID=History of Stoneheim
STONEHEIM_HISTORY_USAGE_SID=a History of Stoneheim
STONEHEIM_HISTORY_TEXT_SID=[[texts/stoneheimhistory_en.txt]]
STONEHEIM_HISTORY_CODEX_SID=A short text on the history of Stoneheim, the dwarven capital which once stood somewhere else, its original site razed by a great wyrm.
GNORDVAR_HISTORY_SID=History of Gnordvar
GNORDVAR_HISTORY_USAGE_SID=a History of Gnordvar
GNORDVAR_HISTORY_TEXT_SID=[[texts/gnordvarhistory_en.txt]]
GNORDVAR_HISTORY_CODEX_SID=Though the gnomish people claim to have existed long before the fair folk left the world, there is little to support this, other than their claim.  The gnomes are conspicuously absent in the fairy histories, in the surviving writing of the time, and so historians have long taken their claim to only be possible, not certain.  For their part, the gnomes claim to have witnessed or heard of the great slaughters between the fair folk, the giants, and the unlings, and collectively decided it was in their best interest to remain undiscovered.
YEW_HISTORY_SID=History of Yew
YEW_HISTORY_USAGE_SID=a History of Yew
YEW_HISTORY_TEXT_SID=[[texts/yewhistory_en.txt]]
YEW_HISTORY_CODEX_SID=The Yew History tells of the partition of the single race of elves into the modern variant of wood and mountain elves, and of the settlement of the Forest of Yew, the ancestral home of the modern wood elf people.
SHRINES_HISTORY_SID=History of the Shrines
SHRINES_HISTORY_USAGE_SID=a History of the Shrines
SHRINES_HISTORY_TEXT_SID=[[texts/shrines_history_en.txt]]
SHRINES_HISTORY_CODEX_SID=Three enormous structures in three corners of the world: since before recorded history, these shrines have stood deathly still, swallowing anyone stupid enough to try to enter.  But the asymmetry has always intrigued scholars: why three?  Why is the fourth corner empty?  Is there a fourth shrine, somewhere, undiscovered?
HISTORY_KELL_EMPIRE_SID=History of the Kell Empire
HISTORY_KELL_EMPIRE_USAGE_SID=a History of the Kell Empire
HISTORY_KELL_EMPIRE_TEXT_SID=[[texts/kellhistory_en.txt]]
HISTORY_KELL_EMPIRE_CODEX_SID=Officially, the Carcassian Empire has existed forever, and the emperor blessed by the divine.  But historians know that it is just one in a series of empires, and that before it, the most significant empire was Kell.  This empire was eventually brought down by a combination of revolt, raids in the ship-lanes, and natural catastrophes, and its sudden disappearance in history was followed by a long period of darkness in the historical record.
MINOR_HEALING_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Minor Healing
UNID_MINOR_HEALING_SPELLBOOK_SID=pocket-sized spellbook
MINOR_HEALING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Minor Healing
UNID_MINOR_HEALING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a pocket-sized spellbook
MINOR_HEALING_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A favourite cantrip is that of minor healing, which heals scars and closes wounds.  The role of a hedge-wizard is often that of a heal-all, asked to help set bones and deal with more serious injuries.  In those cases where the caster is unsure of the true extent of the injury, this spell can help with the guesswork, allowing the body to heal its troubles faster on its own.
FLAME_DART_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Flame Dart
UNID_FLAME_DART_SPELLBOOK_SID=ordinary spellbook
FLAME_DART_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Flame Dart
UNID_FLAME_DART_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an ordinary spellbook
FLAME_DART_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=After a short series of geometric gestures, the caster utters the words, and then makes a quick motion as if throwing an actual dart.  When this happens, a four-inch, fiery dart flies toward the target, burning in place for several seconds before the magic falters and the dart disappears.  This is a good bit of minor magic, and can cause serious damage if thrown right, though most wizards grumble that it's only a cantrip, it's not true magic, and that their elemental spells are far superior.
STEEL_WIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Steel Wind
UNID_STEEL_WIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=crumbling spellbook
STEEL_WIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Steel Wind
UNID_STEEL_WIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a crumbling spellbook
STEEL_WIND_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=An impressive bit of weather-bending, Steel Wind calls the wind about the caster.  Weaker at the edges, it can help deflect poorly-aimed strikes; and by the caster's skin, it becomes intense, hard as metal, providing a protection superior to mail.  Adventurers share a kind of fellowship, and those who know this spell will often pass their well-worn spellbooks on to others, knowing that in the dark of a dungeon, this spell can be the difference to surviving or not.
BLINK_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Blink
UNID_BLINK_SPELLBOOK_SID=illustrated spellbook
BLINK_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Blink
UNID_BLINK_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an illustrated spellbook
BLINK_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Wizards are known to be able to bend space, and with a single step, appear hundreds of metres away.  Hedge-casters have their own version of this spell, though it is less powerful, as the key words of teleportation are not spoken.  Blink allows the caster to appear suddenly somewhere nearby.  It is uncontrollable, and can cause the target to land somewhere less desirable, but in certain situations, it can help provide an important means of escape.
SPIRIT_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Spirit Bolt
UNID_SPIRIT_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=damaged spellbook
SPIRIT_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Spirit Bolt
UNID_SPIRIT_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a damaged spellbook
SPIRIT_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the most powerful attacking cantrips is Spirit Bolt, which draws on divine fury to unleash a wide, glowing bolt of energy at the target.  The religious orthodoxy claims that this is not divine power, and that only they are capable of tapping into that wellstream, but those who have survived a direct strike speak later of being dumbstruck, held in awe, and there is little doubt among the hedge-wizards what the source of this power really is.
PURIFY_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Purify
UNID_PURIFY_SPELLBOOK_SID=glossed textbook
PURIFY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Purify
UNID_PURIFY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a glossed textbook
PURIFY_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the more useful day-to-day cantrips is Purify, which removes poison from the bloodstream.  It does so by vaporizing it, forcing it out of the skin as a cloud of hazy, green gas, which with the last word of the incantation, is blown away by a sudden gust of wind.
ANTIMAGIC_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Antimagic Shield
UNID_ANTIMAGIC_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_SID=encoded spellbook
ANTIMAGIC_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Antimagic Shield
UNID_ANTIMAGIC_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an encoded spellbook
ANTIMAGIC_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Wizards are quick to pooh-pooh the abilities of hedge-wizards and hedge-witches, claiming the spells to be inferior imitations of the powerful magics they learn in the tower.  And while this might be true, hedge-casters have recently invented a new cantrip as a kind of answer, corrupting the speaking of some Runic words to call a shield of magical protection.  This weakens a wizard's arcane magics on contact, rendering battles between a wizard and hedge-witch of similar abilities a much closer affair than would be thought.
BRAVERY_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Bravery
UNID_BRAVERY_SPELLBOOK_SID=miniature spellbook
BRAVERY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Bravery
UNID_BRAVERY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a miniature spellbook
BRAVERY_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Though the spell is traditionally called "Bravery", it doesn't actually cause the recipient to become braver, simply more successful in landing attacks.  This can as a side-effect make one braver, as landing each of a series of wild strikes can make one feel blessed by the divine.  The spell is cast by speaking a few magical rhyming couplets, and then drawing the arm outward as if unsheathing a sword.
FORCE_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Force Bolt
UNID_FORCE_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=red ink spellbook
FORCE_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Force Bolt
UNID_FORCE_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a red ink spellbook
FORCE_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The quintessential cantrip, Force Bolt is a spell learned almost as a rite of passage by all hedge-witches.  It summons an invisible, focused force that slams through a number of targets in a given direction.  Those on the receiving end have described it as being punched in the gut by a titan, or hit by a battering ram held by two dozen men.  The spell's casting is quite dramatic, as after the spoken component, the caster slowly draws the fist back, past the body, before the releasing the spell with a powerful forward punch.
CLEANSING_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Cleansing
UNID_CLEANSING_SPELLBOOK_SID=spiralbound spellbook
CLEANSING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Cleansing
UNID_CLEANSING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spiralbound spellbook
CLEANSING_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The process by which creatures spontaneously reproduce isn't fully understood, but the way in which to stop it is.  The caster takes something small and fragile - a twig, for example, or a leaf - tears it in half, and after speaks a single Runic word.  The two halves then come together and refuse themselves, and any nearby splitters or breeders suddenly find themselves unable to reproduce any further.
MAPPING_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Mapping
UNID_MAPPING_SPELLBOOK_SID=academic spellbook
MAPPING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Mapping
UNID_MAPPING_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an academic spellbook
MAPPING_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The Mapping cantrip reveals to the caster information which they do not already know.  It illuminates areas around them in the mind of the magician, revealing bits of information, a small amount at a time, helping them to understand the structure of nearby places, information that, when exploring, can be very helpful indeed.
CRUMBLE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Crumble
UNID_CRUMBLE_SPELLBOOK_SID=cursive spellbook
CRUMBLE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Crumble
UNID_CRUMBLE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a cursive spellbook
CRUMBLE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Causing things to fall apart, the magic of Crumble is in the entropy it imparts.  It causes whatever it touches to become soft and brittle, and easily moved.  When used on clay, it turns to sand; rock becomes dust, and the caster is able to slowly burrow through the ground as if a strange, subterranean creature.
BLAST_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Blast
UNID_BLAST_SPELLBOOK_SID=riveting spellbook
BLAST_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Blast
UNID_BLAST_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a riveting spellbook
BLAST_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Tapping into the arcane wellspring used by proper wizards, the spell of Blast summons a sweeping arc of magical energy, which crashes out in front of the caster, engulfing its victims in blue-white magical fire.  This spell is flashy, but costly - the fire burns wide, but looks more dangerous than it actually is, and most spellcasters will save this spell for when they are facing a stampede of hostile foes.
INFERNO_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Inferno
UNID_INFERNO_SPELLBOOK_SID=serialized spellbook
INFERNO_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Inferno
UNID_INFERNO_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a serialized spellbook
INFERNO_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the most powerful of all magics is, indeed, a cantrip, one lost to the world for many tens of thousands of years.  Written down by the race of builders, it summons a wall of raging fire that incinerates everything in its path.  The spell of Blast, well-known among hedgelings, can be seen as the palest, weakest imitation, one that cannot even hope to approach the apocalyptic fury unleashed by a casting of Inferno.
SHARDS_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Shards
UNID_SHARDS_SPELLBOOK_SID=charred spellbook
SHARDS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Shards
UNID_SHARDS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a charred spellbook
SHARDS_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The most dangerous cantrip still cast is Shards, a powerful earth magic that summons a hail of stones from the sky, which then explode several feet above the ground.  This creates an enormous number of jagged pieces of shrapnel, which fly indiscriminately in all directions.  These are propelled with such force that they can pierce cleanly through armour, lodging in bone and muscle tissue, severing veins and arteries.
ELECTRIC_ARC_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Electric Arc
UNID_ELECTRIC_ARC_SPELLBOOK_SID=fading spellbook
ELECTRIC_ARC_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Electric Arc
UNID_ELECTRIC_ARC_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a fading spellbook
ELECTRIC_ARC_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Less powerful than summoning true lightning, electric arc creates a bolt of electricity out of the finger or weapon wielded by the caster.  It looks impressive, but is usually not fatal; though it is painful, its usual purpose is to try to inflict paralysis, allowing the spellbinder to slowly finish off their opponent in the manner of their choosing.
REPEL_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Repel
UNID_REPEL_SPELLBOOK_SID=illegible spellbook
REPEL_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Repel
UNID_REPEL_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an illegible spellbook
REPEL_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=An interesting cantrip, and one in the arsenal of most adventuring priests and wizards, is Repel.  As the spell is cast, the chanter makes a quick pushing motion, and the magic is put into effect.  Trading damage for displacement, the caster becomes able to knock back nearby creatures.  This can be done to create an escape route, but the clever have figured out that it can also displace creatures into dangerous areas - into the ocean, say, or to send them plunging in the open air.
WREATH_OF_FIRE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Wreath of Fire
UNID_WREATH_OF_FIRE_SPELLBOOK_SID=dusty spellbook
WREATH_OF_FIRE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Wreath of Fire
UNID_WREATH_OF_FIRE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a dusty spellbook
WREATH_OF_FIRE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the first spells any wizard learns is to call up fire, controlling it by spinning it in spirals around their body.  A skilled wizard can control this fire, sending it spiralling not just up and down, but out, creating a circle of burnt destruction around the wizard that follows the fire's path.
DRAGON_BREATH_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Dragon Breath
UNID_DRAGON_BREATH_SPELLBOOK_SID=illuminated spellbook
DRAGON_BREATH_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Dragon Breath
UNID_DRAGON_BREATH_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an illuminated spellbook
DRAGON_BREATH_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=It's said that hedge-wizards wish they could be wizards, and wizards wish they could be dragons.  The spell of Dragon Breath does little to deny this, allowing the caster to spew a cone of dragonfire from their mouth.  This being magic, rather than the natural bodily function of a dragon, the fire is less intense, but the effect is still undeniably impressive, and more than one battle has been turned when a warrior-mage began to breath dragonfire towards the opposing troops.
LIGHTNING_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Lightning Bolt
UNID_LIGHTNING_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=bejewelled spellbook
LIGHTNING_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Lightning Bolt
UNID_LIGHTNING_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a bejewelled spellbook
LIGHTNING_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=As wizards learn to conjure the elements, they eventually focus their efforts on the heavens themselves.  With a few words, a practiced wizard can call down lightning, and in the instant before it would reach the ground, bend it.  The lightning then arcs toward the intended target, banking off any surfaces in its path.  The high tower ensures that physics is part of its curriculum, and that wizards are aware of angles of relection - when this spell is cast, the wizard must be certain that they will not end up within the lightning's path.
SHOCKWAVE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Shockwave
UNID_SHOCKWAVE_SPELLBOOK_SID=hidebound spellbook
SHOCKWAVE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Shockwave
UNID_SHOCKWAVE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a hidebound spellbook
SHOCKWAVE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=To summon a shockwave, the caster speaks a series of sharp Runic trochees, each one summoning more and more potential energy.  As this continues, the fist becomes heavy, until the pointer where the wizard cannot fight gravity any further.  They slam their fist into the ground, and a massive shockwave spreads outward.  The force from this is terrible: it can re-open wounds, damage tissue, break bones, so that those killed by the outward wave might not even seem to have suffered any visible wound, lying serenely on the ground as if fallen asleep forever.
FLIGHT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Flight
UNID_FLIGHT_SPELLBOOK_SID=annotated spellbook
FLIGHT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Flight
UNID_FLIGHT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an annotated spellbook
FLIGHT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=As long as people have walked long and tedious distances, there has been the desire to fly.  And while some have tried inventive approaches such as jumping off a cliff while wearing artificial wings (this does not work) or jumping on rocs or giant eagles and trying to ride them (they do not like this), the most practical approach has been the magical.  It's said that a gnomish wizard, thousands of years in the past, got into a bar bet that he could fly off a nearby cliff.  Hammered on half a bottle of whisky, he jumped, and in a moment of sudden inspiration, spoke the words that made the spell possible.  Everyone agreed that his approach was stupid and basically suicidal, but after they caught up with him, and after he sobered up, they made sure to get him to write everything down anyway.
CROSS_OF_FLAME_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Cross of Flame
UNID_CROSS_OF_FLAME_SPELLBOOK_SID=pristine spellbook
CROSS_OF_FLAME_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Cross of Flame
UNID_CROSS_OF_FLAME_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a pristine spellbook
CROSS_OF_FLAME_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A powerful elemental spell, Cross of Flame combines geometry with arcane magics.  Splitting their mind into four segments, the wizard casts four spells that start simultaneously.  This allows them to send flame rippling in each of the cardinal directions, and the characteristic burn patterns, resembling a crucific, is what gives this spell its name.
FIREBALL_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Fireball
UNID_FIREBALL_SPELLBOOK_SID=hardcover spellbook
FIREBALL_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Fireball
UNID_FIREBALL_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a hardcover spellbook
FIREBALL_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Originally, wizards cast fireballs by sending short bursts of magical flame towards a target.  But the energy and mindfulness needed to direct this properly takes away from the amount of energy available to burn as fire itself, and so years ago, an adaptation to the fireball spell was made.  Now, wizards use themselves as the central point for the spell, causing the flame to erupt in all directions.  This cannot be controlled - it will burn friend and foe alike - but is devastatingly powerful, and to master this spell is to be seen by one's peers as a master of arcane magic as well.
ELEMENTAL_MASTERY_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Elemental Mastery
UNID_ELEMENTAL_MASTERY_SPELLBOOK_SID=ancient spellbook
ELEMENTAL_MASTERY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Elemental Mastery
UNID_ELEMENTAL_MASTERY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an ancient spellbook
ELEMENTAL_MASTERY_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Arcane spellcasters can call down the elements to rain them on their opponents, but they can also draw protective strength from them as well.  Elemental mastery is, as its name suggests, a way of becoming inuring one's self to lightning, fire, and cold; to take less damage, of course, but also to potentially avoid the deadly side effects - paralysis, blindness, and slowness, respectively - that come along with massive overexposure to these elements.
FROST_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Frost Bolt
UNID_FROST_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=overdue spellbook
FROST_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Frost Bolt
UNID_FROST_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an overdue spellbook
FROST_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Elemental spells form a core part of the wizard's repertoire, and frost bolt is the favourite of many wizards.  Besides the practical applications - such as putting out a neighbour's housefire, or putting down a raging goblin - its deep and painful cold has the advantage of slowing down the things that it hits, causing them to become dumber, slower, more sluggish.  This can be very handy indeed when deep in a forgotten cavern, and staring down some eldritch being - to escape through the blackness, sprinting and trying to remember the way back is certainly superior to being dead.
FIRE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Fire Storm
UNID_FIRE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=singed spellbook
FIRE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Fire Storm
UNID_FIRE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a singed spellbook
FIRE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Fire can be thrown in different directions, but accomplished wizards learn an old fae spell which calls down streaks of fire from the heavens.  This spell, once set in motion, cannot be controlled.  As fire falls, it can hit or miss the caster's ideal targets, but due to the random pattern of the rain, it can also hit targets multiple times.  Wizards who favour these spells tend to be gamblers, or at least, altogether certain of their luck.  The energy required to cast this spell is considerable, and most seasoned wizards do not have more than a couple of castings in them.
ICE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Ice Storm
UNID_ICE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=dog-eared spellbook
ICE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Ice Storm
UNID_ICE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a dog-eared spellbook
ICE_STORM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=When wizards summon an ice storm, they aren't just summoning snow and sleet - they're also calling down massive chunks of hail, some as large as a man's fist.  These inflict terrible damage on their victim.  Landing with the force of a club or stone, hundreds of these fall within a few seconds, causing chaos as those around the wizard flee for their lives, trying desperately to run outside the storm's wide perimeter.
LIGHTNING_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Lightning Storm
UNID_LIGHTNING_STORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=vulgate spellbook
LIGHTNING_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Lightning storm
UNID_LIGHTNING_STORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a vulgate spellbook
LIGHTNING_STORM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Not an elemental binding spell, Lightning Storm is instead a dramatic kind of weather-working.  The caster calls a vertical wind, and as air is driven up, the caster heats it quickly, causing storm conditions to form immediately overhead.  Then with a word, the storm breaks: torrential rain gushes down, and bolt after bolt of lightning is released, speaking to the anger of the heavens at their manipulation by earthly powers.
MAELSTROM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Maelstrom
UNID_MAELSTROM_SPELLBOOK_SID=sammelband spellbook
MAELSTROM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Maelstrom
UNID_MAELSTROM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a sammelband spellbook
MAELSTROM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Maelstrom is to Fireball what Fireball is to Wreath of Fire.  One of the most difficult spells in the magical repertoire, it calls the kind of energy present in solar fusion.  Holding it for a fraction of a second, the wizard then loses control, sending it outward.  The intense heat leaves little standing.  It incinerates trees, turns flesh and bone to ash, and as it sweeps outward, it leaves a trail of destruction that can take a generation to restore.
ABSOLUTE_ZERO_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Absolute Zero
UNID_ABSOLUTE_ZERO_SPELLBOOK_SID=humming spellbook
ABSOLUTE_ZERO_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Absolute Zero
UNID_ABSOLUTE_ZERO_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a humming spellbook
ABSOLUTE_ZERO_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The strongest of the spells of elemental cold, Absolute Zero does not rely on snow or ice, but rather on a sudden, terrifying drop in temperature.  Creeping out in a wide field in front of the caster, the temperature becomes colder than even the ambient temperature of the cosmos, dropping to absolute zero, the total absence of heat.  Creatures caught within this cold suffer quickly and excruciatingly: the skin freezes, suffering from frostbite immediately; underneath the skin, the blood clots.  If the body experiences more than a few seconds of exposure, it freezes completely, shattering like glass under the smallest amount of force.
VORPAL_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Vorpal Bolt
UNID_VORPAL_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_SID=hieroglyphic spellbook
VORPAL_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Vorpal Bolt
UNID_VORPAL_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a hieroglyphic spellbook
VORPAL_BOLT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A spell for gamblers and the desperate, Vorpal Bolt requires a large amount of magical energy for its relatively little damage, cutting barely worse than a broadsword against a mailed opponent.  But every so often, it does much, much more.  Tapping into some sort of universal energy source, it cuts with incredible speed, cleaving its victims in half, regardless of size or power.  Not so impressive against a kestrel or goblin, perhaps, but dealt successfully against a tarasque or great wyrm, the resultant hide could keep the wizard's family in riches for generations.
DIG_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Dig
UNID_DIG_SPELLBOOK_SID=large print spellbook
DIG_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Dig
UNID_DIG_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a large print spellbook
DIG_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Though each sphere of magic has an assortment of spells, they tend towards certain stereotypes.  Divine magic is restorative and protective, while Primordial magic is ruthless and offensive.  Mystic magic is concerned with the addition and removal of statuses, and Cantrips are weaker, easier versions of the other spheres' spells.  Arcane magic tends towards the offensive as well, but has some useful spells for adventuring, and one of these is Dig.  All it does is turn earth and rock to dust, creating a passage for the wizard.  This can be used to create a shelter, or hide from dangerous threats; it can be used to look for treasure, or search out hidden rooms.  Relatively few wizards make the jump to adventuring, but those who do often prepare themselves by memorizing this spell before they go.
HOLOCAUST_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Holocaust
UNID_HOLOCAUST_SPELLBOOK_SID=looseleaf spellbook
HOLOCAUST_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Holocaust
UNID_HOLOCAUST_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a looseleaf spellbook
HOLOCAUST_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The crown jewel in the magical knowledge of the Elysians, a spell learned briefly then lost with the people themselves, Holocaust is a magically-created, nuclear chain reaction, the caster standing protected at the centre.  As the energy is released, the landscape is levelled.  The ground around the caster is deformed, pressed downward, leaving them standing on a small, unremarkable mound, untouched by the blast, surrounded by death and destruction on all sides.
METEOR_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Meteor
UNID_METEOR_SPELLBOOK_SID=shorthand spellbook
METEOR_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Meteor
UNID_METEOR_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a shorthand spellbook
METEOR_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A spectacular spell, Meteor summons a meteor shower out of the heavens.  The spell is preceded by a moment of sudden cold, like the minutes before a thunderstorm, only far more pronounced.  Drawing power from someplace else in the universe, the wizard suddenly expels it high above, creating a tear in the heavens, a link through space.  And through that gap, the meteor shower emerges, raining death and destruction from above, a spectacular show which, seen from elsewhere, seems like something stolen from the earliest magical days.
TELEPORT_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Teleport
UNID_TELEPORT_SPELLBOOK_SID=broadside spellbook
TELEPORT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Teleport
UNID_TELEPORT_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a broadside spellbook
TELEPORT_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Sometimes, when facing down certain death, the most important decision isn't how to fight, but not to.  Wizards are, as a rule, not particularly fast, and most can't even hope to outpace the beasts around them.  For situations like these, there's teleportation.  A whisper of words is followed by a clap of the hands, and the wizard appears suddenly somewhere else - sometimes nearby, often not, so while this incantation carries an element of chance, it can provide a life-saving escape when staring down the worst.
WARP_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Warp
UNID_WARP_SPELLBOOK_SID=ringbound spellbook
WARP_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Warp
UNID_WARP_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a ringbound spellbook
WARP_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Adventurers thrive on the danger of the job, not so much the boredom: while most live for the thrill of diving deep into ancient caverns or catacombs, once everything is cleared, and the adventurer laden with treasure, no one particularly relishes the tedium of coming back up again.  Wizards in the high tower may learn a specialized form of teleportation, which bends space up and down, rather than the usual side to side.  This allows escape from the deepest dungeon, taking the sorceror out of the depths and back to where they were standing in the world above.
HEALING_WORD_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Healing Word
UNID_HEALING_WORD_SPELLBOOK_SID=well-worn spellbook
HEALING_WORD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Healing Word
UNID_HEALING_WORD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a well-worn spellbook
HEALING_WORD_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A useful spell taught early in training to priests, Healing Word calls upon divine will to heal the caster.  Sheathed in an aura of radiant light, they find their wounds healed - the skin unscarred and smooth, even better than before.  The spell is spoken as a single word, transliterated in Runic, but far older, and it's said that this word compels, rather than requests, the intervention of the divine.
SMITE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Smite
UNID_SMITE_SPELLBOOK_SID=rune-covered spellbook
SMITE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Smite
UNID_SMITE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a rune-covered spellbook
SMITE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Divine magic is less terrifying than Primordial or Arcane magic - its energies don't pulse or flare, or summon elements out of the earth.  But it is just as capable of being used for offensive purposes.  Those close to the divine can call their irritation, lashing out with divine permission to strike and silence.  This is part of the reason why wizards rarely pick a fight with religious orders: their magic necessarily verbal, being dumbstruck by divine will makes things suddenly deadly.
HOLY_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Holy
UNID_HOLY_SPELLBOOK_SID=glowing spellbook
HOLY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Holy
UNID_HOLY_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a glowing spellbook
HOLY_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A fearsome spell cast only by the most experienced and learned priests, Holy summons a massive aura of light which erupts outward, an explosion of divine strength.  It is a difficult spell to cast, requiring a number of precise gestures, each hand working independently.  But unlike similar arcane spells which leave the landscape scorched or frozen, Holy leaves the earth untouched, the only marker of its presence the many dead who, lacking visible wounds, seem to have fallen where they stood.
DIVINE_WIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Divine Wind
UNID_DIVINE_WIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=heavy spellbook
DIVINE_WIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Divine Wind
UNID_DIVINE_WIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a heavy spellbook
DIVINE_WIND_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Calling for divine protection, the priest summons a holy wind, a queer thing, not true weather, which visibly deforms the space around the caster.  Incoming attacks meet chaotic turbulence - often thrust aside, though some find their way through.  The effect of this is strangely hypnotic, the caster seeming to pulse in and out of the world, as if moving about through two very different planes.
DIVINE_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Divine Shield
UNID_DIVINE_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_SID=moth-eaten spellbook
DIVINE_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Divine Shield
UNID_DIVINE_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a moth-eaten spellbook
DIVINE_SHIELD_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Summoning up a semi-circular shield of holy light, the casting of Divine Shield focuses divine intent into a wide area in front of the caster.  This is controlled as if a shield, the light itself hovering a foot or two in front of the shield-arm.  The aura, however, is not true light - physically hard, having the sound of wood when rapped with the knuckles, it holds the strength of a solid plate of steel.  Unlike conventional armour, however, it has no weight at all, and moves with the caster, hovering there to meet each incoming strike.
CURE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Cure
UNID_CURE_SPELLBOOK_SID=large spellbook
CURE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Cure
UNID_CURE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a large spellbook
CURE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the reasons priests are appreciated everywhere is their ability to heal the sick - to draw out illness and poison, and quickly restore the afflicted back to health.  Most priests at some point learn how to deal with poison - Cure removes it completely, causing the victim to surge with a brief flash of light, the poison negated in the bloodstream by the effects of this spell.  As the poison is instantly negated, the body feels briefly out of place, shivering and trembling out of reflex, despite the poison's absence.  But after a minute or two, as the blood recirculates, balance is restored, and the victim feels complete once again.
SOFTEN_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Soften
UNID_SOFTEN_SPELLBOOK_SID=chapbook spellbook
SOFTEN_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Soften
UNID_SOFTEN_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a chapbook spellbook
SOFTEN_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The dark energies of the universe, those that witchlings tap into and which serve the minions of the black god, they leave their mark in terrifying ways: corrupting the skin, hardening it, and spreading to the soft tissues underneath so that the lungs halt, the heart falters, and the body quickly dies.  This effect can be reversed by holy men and women, who call the grace of the divine to restore the body to its original state.  The corruption halts, then reverses, the skin softening, the terror of a slow death quickly released.
BENEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Benediction
UNID_BENEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=samizdat spellbook
BENEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Benediction
UNID_BENEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a samizdat spellbook
BENEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=To call the heavens' healing, say a word: the blessing from on high a ray of light, a benediction from a faceless god, one worshipped silently for years, and then this healing, felt so fully, it's as if the wound was never struck at all.  To cast the spell, the priest will take a bit of bone or wood, and name it as a relic.  Becoming so, its powers are released celestially, a focus for their will, which lets them heal the target who is called out by the priest.
HEAVENLY_HAND_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Heavenly Hand
UNID_HEAVENLY_HAND_SPELLBOOK_SID=plagiarized spellbook
HEAVENLY_HAND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Heavenly Hand
UNID_HEAVENLY_HAND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a plagiarized spellbook
HEAVENLY_HAND_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Hedge-wizards speak of a powerful, lost cantrip, one that could protect against both the physical and heavenly realms.  Though the cantrip is lost, it bears a striking resemblance to Heavenly Hand, a divine spell which is, surely coincidentally, written mostly in the common script, with a smattering of Runic words.  Those who've studied it have said that the common words conjure up protection against ordinary weapons, while the Runic words ward against the divine.  The spell is perhaps a bit of a hybrid, but considered of the Divine sphere for hedge-wizards are not able to fully master its casting.
RADIANT_BEAM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Radiant Beam
UNID_RADIANT_BEAM_SPELLBOOK_SID=parchment spellbook
RADIANT_BEAM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Radiant Beam
UNID_RADIANT_BEAM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a parchment spellbook
RADIANT_BEAM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Summoning a beam of holy light, the caster speaks a sentence in Runic to imbue it with sudden fury.  The light is released towards the target, forming a beam of pure energy that instantly strikes everything in its path.  The light, its said, shows its victims all the ways in which they have wronged; this can be so overwhelming as to leave them dumbstruck, unable to speak as they remember all at once the ways in which they've strayed.
DIVINE_FORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Divine Form
UNID_DIVINE_FORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=foolscap spellbook
DIVINE_FORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Divine Form
UNID_DIVINE_FORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a foolscap spellbook
DIVINE_FORM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Seen by some as a heresy, others as a wondrous blessing of the highest order, Divine Form allows the caster to assume the form of the divine for a few brief moments.  While imbued with these tremendous powers, the caster burns with invincibility, unable to feel pain, unable to even have it inflicted, and for a moment stands equally with the Nine.
ABSOLUTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Absolution
UNID_ABSOLUTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=edifying spellbook
ABSOLUTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Absolution
UNID_ABSOLUTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=an edifying spellbook
ABSOLUTION_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A spell of terrifying strength and intensity, Absolution is so-named because it provides release from the material world, rending the soul from the body and sending it to the underworld.  Few could possibly hope to survive it - it strikes with such force as to peel the skin from the body, ignite the hair, melt armour - but those who have, those who have somehow stood up to heavenly creatures and survive, talk about the intense pain and overwhelming peace, felt in equal measures.
WRAITH_FORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Wraith Form
UNID_WRAITH_FORM_SPELLBOOK_SID=rotting spellbook
WRAITH_FORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Wraith Form
UNID_WRAITH_FORM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a rotting spellbook
WRAITH_FORM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Wizards will freely admit that the one thing they cannot do is imitate the dead.  Allowing the caster to step halfway into another universe, the spell of Wraith Form grants their body ghost-like properties in our own.  Those in Wraith Form have the appearance of the shimmering dead, looking like marsh gas or a pale spirit.  The body lengthens and contracts, can walk through walls as if they were open air; there are a number of cases in history of oracles simply stepping into a dragon's hoard, taking a few choice items, and vanishing back inside the rocky earth, the solid rock around them reverberating with the dragon's fury.
POISON_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Poison
UNID_POISON_SPELLBOOK_SID=faded spellbook
POISON_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Poison
UNID_POISON_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a faded spellbook
POISON_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The spell of Poison is not the same as the snake's venom.  Speaking the words and fingering a bit of metal - a key, perhaps, or a dagger's blade - this spell puts traces of poisonous elements directly into the victim's bloodstream, conjuring arsenic, cadmium, lead.  It is agonizing.  Feeling as if their entire body is on fire, the victim claws and scratches, trying to stop the coursing of their own lifeblood.  This spell only takes hold for a few minutes, though, and with its expiration, the blood immediately becomes normal again, the agonizing pain strangely and immediately gone.
BLIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Blind
UNID_BLIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=grimy spellbook
BLIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Blind
UNID_BLIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a grimy spellbook
BLIND_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=It is difficult to convey the terror the sighted feel when their vision suddenly fails.  The world plunges into darkness not gradually, but immediately.  And the sensation is jarring - those who fall under the spell of blindness often suddenly fall, having relied on sight to form a mental model of their surroundings.  This spell is taught early to oracles, for it is versatile and useful - while it can be used to gain an advantage in combat, and often is, teachers try to impress upon their students that the blind find it difficult to find the silent, and more importantly, that one does not have to fight everything one sees.
MUTE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Mute
UNID_MUTE_SPELLBOOK_SID=papyrus spellbook
MUTE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Mute
UNID_MUTE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a papyrus spellbook
MUTE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Summoning up divine energies, the oracle strips away what's holy, and works with what remains.  And what remains is pure mind-bending energy that causes aphasia in the victim, preventing not only speech but even the mental formulation of words.  Against something like a goblin, a dragon, or a titan, this is admittedly not very useful; but those that know deep magics can be quieted, allowing the caster to impart a quick death, or simply beat an escape in safety.
SPELLBIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Spellbind
UNID_SPELLBIND_SPELLBOOK_SID=grand spellbook
SPELLBIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Spellbind
UNID_SPELLBIND_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a grand spellbook
SPELLBIND_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=As an adjective, spellbound is watered-down.  Usually dredged up to describe love (or at least lust), the word loses its power when considered next to true spellbinding.  Summoning up arcane magics, the oracle taps into the mystic sphere to remove all offensive properties.  The actual energies of the spell remain constant, and so without the torrents of fire, or skin-stripping magics, something else takes its place.  The pure arcane energy blasts the spirit temporarily from this world.  In this state, the body can slowly act, but coordinated movement is impossible; as a result, the target stays standing in place, steeling themselves for the worst, imagining each sound as the precursor to a sudden, violent, and helpless death.
HASTE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Haste
UNID_HASTE_SPELLBOOK_SID=yellowing spellbook
HASTE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Haste
UNID_HASTE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a yellowing spellbook
HASTE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A bit of speed makes a world of difference.  The oracle speeds up by stepping slightly out of time, moving a little bit faster, and gaining a crucial advantage in dangerous situations.  Many mystics are content to simply cast this spell, and revel in their newfound quickness, but the wise know that this spell can be combined with a casting of Slow on a particular target, amplifying the effects of Haste dramatically.
SLOW_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Slow
UNID_SLOW_SPELLBOOK_SID=small spellbook
SLOW_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Slow
UNID_SLOW_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a small spellbook
SLOW_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=The spell of slowness is deeply unnerving to the victim - though they appear to think, move, and act at normal speeds, everything around them moves faster.  In the ancient myths, a peasant wanders into the woods and finds a nymph bathing; in a rage, she casts this spell, and as he wanders out of the woods, he finds the seasons change, the leaves dropping off the trees.  Arriving back at home, the peasant learns his children have aged and left, his wife become creased and grey, before finally understanding his parents have long since passed, on their very deathbed wondering what had happened to their beloved son.
STONE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Stone
UNID_STONE_SPELLBOOK_SID=brittle spellbook
STONE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Stone
UNID_STONE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a brittle spellbook
STONE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Distilling the essence of primordial magic, the caster taps into the deep source of the universe's energy, and then releases it.  But unable to fully control it in the way a witchling would, the mystic focuses it in a different way.  The shadowy energies dissipate, and the spell becomes a focus for pure entropy.  Petrification is almost assured.  The victims limb stiffen quickly, slowing and freezing, and if not treated quickly, death is certain, the body twisting into a pained, grotesque statue.
CURSE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Curse
UNID_CURSE_SPELLBOOK_SID=scribbled spellbook
CURSE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Curse
UNID_CURSE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a scribbled spellbook
CURSE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=A hex, a curse, a malignant charm - however it's called, it brings bad luck and misfortune to its victim.  The body withers, becoming weaker, less sure, fumbling, while at the same time becoming unluckier in combat.  Daggers find skin; armour becomes weaker; axes strike true.  An old wives' tale is that killing the caster of the curse releases it, but as many who've tried it have found, this only solves the initial source of the problem, and the curse itself remains.
AIM_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Aim
UNID_AIM_SPELLBOOK_SID=freshly-bound spellbook
AIM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Aim
UNID_AIM_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a freshly-bound spellbook
AIM_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Though they are spellcasters and not properly trained in the fighting arts, oracles have found ways to use their knowledge of the basic properties of the universe to manipulate outcomes in their favour.  Those who have challenged the rod-wielding spellcasters in battle speak of a strange luck, whereby the oracle's attacks land with startling success.  They speak too of a spell cast just before, of how the oracle grips their weapon tightly, speaks a few words, and how the eyes becoming a startling shade of green.
HAZE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Haze
UNID_HAZE_SPELLBOOK_SID=gilt-edged spellbook
HAZE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Haze
UNID_HAZE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a gilt-edged spellbook
HAZE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Aim and Haze are two faces of the same coin.  While Aim allows the caster great luck in combat, landing blows easily, Haze causes its target to miss and fumble, sometimes dropping their weapon altogether.  After the oracle casts the spell, the victim's hands feel heavy.  The tips of the fingers become numb, the arms heavily fatigued, the legs iron weights.  In this state, combat becomes very difficult indeed.  The victim forgets their training, missing easy strikes, and ends up reverting to flailing about awkwardly, allowing the caster to easily juke and dodge.
TIMEWALK_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Timewalk
UNID_TIMEWALK_SPELLBOOK_SID=vellum spellbook
TIMEWALK_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Timewalk
UNID_TIMEWALK_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a vellum spellbook
TIMEWALK_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Greatest of the mystic spells, Timewalk allows the oracle to literally step out of time.  The magics are unstable, and this is only possible briefly, but while in this state, they can move around freely as everything around them is frozen in place.  Some have thought to link this to teleportation, but wizards and oracles both deny this: teleportation is the result of a bending in space, while timewalk is the manipulation of the fabric of time itself.
UNCURSE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Uncurse
UNID_UNCURSE_SPELLBOOK_SID=dragonhide spellbook
UNCURSE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Uncurse
UNID_UNCURSE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a dragonhide spellbook
UNCURSE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Cursed items are more than just a nuisance.  They can be actively dangerous, for they cannot be easily removed, causing the wearer to make do with substandard and unlucky equipment in deadly situations.  Fortunately, oracles learn early how to deal with such problems.  The curse that binds an item is simply a field of energy - by speaking its inversion, it can be removed completely, dispersed as a surge of energy that those in the vicinity feel for just a second.
DETECT_TRAPS_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Detect Traps
UNID_DETECT_TRAPS_SPELLBOOK_SID=dense spellbook
DETECT_TRAPS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Detect Traps
UNID_DETECT_TRAPS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a dense spellbook
DETECT_TRAPS_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=One of the abilities of those who study Mystic magic is to be able to see things as they really are.  Oracles describe this as a wavering, their vision shimmering in places to reveal the hidden.  This can be useful in a number of situations - noticing poisoned food, for example, or sensing ambushes - but one of the everyday uses is for noticing deadly and well-concealed traps.  In a dungeon, the rock shimmers, or appears discoloured, and after a second or two of concentration, the mystic is able to see through it completely, revealing the trap hidden underneath.
BLESS_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Bless
UNID_BLESS_SPELLBOOK_SID=logographic spellbook
BLESS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Bless
UNID_BLESS_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a logographic spellbook
BLESS_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Though priests can give divine blessings, only oracles can bless everyday things.  They argue it is the same process: the means by which the divine grant favour and steady luck to their followers is the exact same way a blessed sword finds its mark, drawing from the same universal energies, but described, oracles say, as a miracle of the divine, rather than as a manipulation of the universe's winds of fate.
MALEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Malediction
UNID_MALEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_SID=chickenscratch spellbook
MALEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Malediction
UNID_MALEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a chickenscratch spellbook
MALEDICTION_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=An ancient curse written by the Elysians, Malediction hits with the force of a tarasque while inflicting all manner of crippling hexes: blindness and stoning, poison, disfiguration, and more.  Guarded closely, its casting was reserved only for shunnings, those times in which an Elysian committed a crime so great, that they were given a Malediction, whipped, and sent out alone into the world.  Their limbs stiffening, their body failing, the afflicted was left to wander without food or hope, alone, no way back home.
RAGE_SPELLBOOK_SID=spellbook of Rage
UNID_RAGE_SPELLBOOK_SID=screwbound spellbook
RAGE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a spellbook of Rage
UNID_RAGE_SPELLBOOK_USAGE_SID=a screwbound spellbook
RAGE_SPELLBOOK_CODEX_SID=Though oracles are not wizards, they are called "fighting wizards" by many who either don't know or don't care about semantics.  Whereas wizards have their knotty staves, filled with wards and magics, oracles have long fighting staves, and with a casting of Rage, become the equal of any warrior or pugilist.  Clouding the mind, it summons a black anger that focuses the power of the caster.  While under this spell, blows land easily, both for and on the caster, but the caster's own attacks become far more powerful, landing with the force of an ogre's fists, easily breaching armour, flesh, and bone.

TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_START_SID=Twille looks up from his tome.  "To the north-west is a ruined monastery.  Off its south east coast is a tiny island, exposed to the elements."
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_START2_SID="A sailor told me that he saw someone there, reading.  What would be read in such ancient ruins, anyway?  I'm intrigued.  Could you help?"
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_START3_SID="I found something in the library archives that I think might interest you.  Perhaps we could work out a trade?"
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Fragments of History
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring the book from the south-eastern ruins at Stonewall to Twille.

TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="There's a book on a small island off Stonewall monastery.  Bring to me, and I'll trade you an interesting find."
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Here - I found this deep in our archives.  Appropriately, it's Kellurian.  I have no clue what it does, but it must be important to survive so long."
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="A deal's a deal.  It's yours.  I wouldn't know what to do with it, anyway."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START_SID=Kew looks you over. "I know your kind.  Eager for treasure and fame, keen to hone your name and have it ring through the ages."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START2_SID="Perhaps we can arrange a deal.  There is a dungeon to the south-east.  I used to explore it in my youth, those days long since gone."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START3_SID="But something has changed.  It now teems with monsters, and the wind carries a single name: Siriath."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START4_SID="One of the guards scouted and told of black whispers several levels down, though the dungeon goes further.  End this!"
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Voices in the Dark

HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_START_SID=Hild smiles weakly. "Cloaks for the children, robes for the churchmen, and on top of that, Hrothgar wants a new mantle!"
HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_START2_SID=She looks sadly at her loom. "My supply of whiteflower is dwindling.  I could get more, but it's become dangerous."

HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_COMPLETE_SPECIAL_SID="I will teach you the little you don't know.  But I have something for you.  It is a mantle, a thing of special power."
HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_COMPLETE_SPECIAL2_SID="When I was younger, I picked whiteflower near Wintersea Keep.  One day I found this, tucked away beneath some foundation stones."
HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_COMPLETE_SPECIAL3_SID="It has never rotted, never frayed.  May it protect you as you wend your way through this world."
HRIMGAR_BANDIT_QUEST_START_SID="To the east lies The Barrows, where we bury our dead. Each mound is a grave, and in the centre we buried the ship of Wulf, our first king."
HRIMGAR_BANDIT_QUEST_START2_SID="I have heard vile rumours that graves have been opened, the ship sullied. Graverobbers are stealing the treasures buried to honour the dead."

HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_START2_SID="I have heard of a horrifying creature lurking in the caves and caverns: a monstrous wyrm born of chaos, who grows more powerful by the day."
HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_START3_SID="It would be too much to ask such an undertaking, but if you slay the wyrm, your deeds shall live on in song, your name forever spoken."

HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Hrimgar is shocked to see you.  "We'd heard words from passing sailors that the wyrm was slain.  We thought it was impossible!"
HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="But here you stand.  The world owes you an impossible debt.  We Isenlings are not wealthy, but we do have something for you."
HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="We used to have a few farms in the north shore, when the soil was better.  Hundreds of years ago, we found a great hoard."
HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID="Perhaps it was buried by the people who built Wintersea - perhaps it is older.  But now it is yours."
BLACKSMITH_SUNGEM_QUEST_START_SID=The blacksmith says, "I've heard talk of graverobbers opening the burial ship of the great chief Wulf out in the eastern graveyard."

BLACKSMITH_SUNGEM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SMITH_SID=The blacksmith says, "Take these ingots as well, smith, and show people the importance of a well-forged blade!"

BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_START2_SID="The relics are great gems: the Heart of Heaven, the Heart of the World, and the Heart of the World Beyond.  These contain divine essence."
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_START3_SID="If you bring them to me, I will forge you a blade of no equal!"
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Enshrined in Greatness
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bring the three shrine relics to the blacksmith.
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_REMINDER_SID=The blacksmith growls, "Find me the shrine relics!"
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=The blacksmith, for perhaps the first time in his life, is silent.  As you place the relics by his forge, he is struck by their divine creation.
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=Still saying nothing, he fires up his forge, and begins his work.  Taking small chips from the gems, he works them into the shining blade.
BLACKSMITH_SHRINE_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID=After a time, he speaks: "This is Heart's Fury.  May you use it for great things."
PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_START_SID=The ploughman says, "Harvest has been good this year, as ever, thanks to me. But the rare herbs I am trying to grow require so much light."
PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_START2_SID="Graverobbers have opened Wulf's burial ship, but it is not all bad: I have heard he was buried with a celestial stone, the sun gem."
PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_START3_SID="It's said that it emits light as clear as the sun, and heat too. With it, I could grow these herbs, and feed this village for years..."

PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_COMPLETE_MAGICI_SID=The ploughman says, "But then, I expect you already know that.  I found these strange rocks when I was ploughing near Wintersea.  Take them!"
CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_START_SID=Cynwise looks at you. "To the east are a series of downs, where our ancestors lie buried.  At the centre is a hillock, covered with sage."
CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_START2_SID="Beneath lies a ship, that of Wulf, our first king.  Within it lies his earthly wealth: ivory, of course, but also gems and jewels."
CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_START3_SID="The greatest of these is the Sun Gem.  You'll know it when you see it!  It is a thing of great power - bring it to me!"
CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Cynwise's eyes light up.  "The Sun Gem!  It is just as beautiful as I'd heard!  Thank you, adventurer!  I will keep it safe."

CYNWISE_MAGICI_QUEST_START2_SID="The black wizard Siriath, in the south-eastern dungeon, is known to have one, and it can also rarely be found when mining through solid rock."
CYNWISE_MAGICI_QUEST_START3_SID="Bring me a shard of magici, adventurer, and I will surely reward you."
CYNWISE_MAGICI_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Shards
CYNWISE_MAGICI_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="A magici shard, adventurer - just one!"

CYNWISE_WINTERSEA_QUEST_START3_SID="Bring me a branch, and I will surely reward you. Be careful - it has become the roost of many birds, and great shrieks have been heard at night!"

CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START_SID="Years ago, some families left to found a new village," Cynwise tells you. "This village was Aeschburh, and lies north-west of here."
CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START2_SID="It was sacked by raiders decades ago.  But now there are lights, visible at night.  My crows tell of digging, and bones.  Something is foul there."
CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START3_SID="The bones are being sent on a black tide somewhere else.  The diggers and their leader bear the black mark, marking them servants of Sceaudgenga."

EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_START2_SID="Then, one night, torches: raiders, spear-men from across the sea-lanes. We fought well - I cut down many men with my greatsword."
EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_START3_SID="Oswald, my chancellor, found boats. My sister and I were cast off like driftwood into the cold sea. I drifted south; she, far to the west."

EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_RECONSIDER_SID=The exile's voice quivers. "That amulet would bring me comfort in my last days. Please let me know if you reconsider."
CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_START_SID=Christof grimaces. "We gnomes mine the earth for gems, which we love dearly.  Our mines are nearby; they sit deep below the mountains."
CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_START2_SID="Many of our miners are missing. We sent scouts, but they've vanished as well. All, that is, but one. He came back half-mad, with grievous wounds."
CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_START3_SID="He talked of sweet music, the music of beasts, led by a man-lion, a black manticore. Slay it, and you will be richly rewarded."
CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Christof smiles.  "Thank you, adventurer.  We will be able to bury our dead, and mine our gems once more.  You have our thanks."

KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_START_SID="Hero," nods Kirin, "You have come at a good time.  To the north-west are foul folk, goblin raiders.  Their ship rests at the ruins of Stonewall."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_START2_SID="It is an ancient monastery. They foul it with their presence, with their worship of the Black Ogre; from there, they plot the sack of Atua-Elar."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_START3_SID="They watch for us, but not for you.  Take this hammer - it is Goblincrusher, an ancient relic.  Kill their captain and they will surely scatter."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="They were a powerful party," says Kirin, "But not as strong as you.  We thank you, and wish you good winds for your travels."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Recently, we excavated an ancient chamber in our ossuary, unmarked for millenia.  We found this mail, silver and gleaming."

GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="I have crafted a great cloak.  It is yours now - it will help protect you from the dark things of the world."
GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="Speaking of which, I have just come across an interesting tome.  It is very fragile, almost crumbling."
GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE4_SID="It is elvish, unspeakably ancient.  It speaks of the famous Floridel of myth, and it is very interesting indeed."
GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE5_SID="It says that some kind of living star fell into the world, tearing apart a great continent into the islands of today."
GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE6_SID="The fair folk somehow fought off this solar monstrosity, but it helped end their reign in the early world."
GILDI_ORB_QUEST_COMPLETE7_SID="They sealed off the creature deep in an ocean prison, and crafted an enormous, magical gate, locked by a single key."

THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_START2_SID="He said that at the centre of that were two things: some kind of abomination, and a small stone, the hardened core of a dead star."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_START3_SID="Bring me that cosmos stone, and I will forge you the greatest sword the world has ever seen."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Thengil looks over the Cosmos Stone.  "This is it?  It doesn't look like much.  If we're being honest, I think you might be cheating me."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=As you pass the stone, his eyes widen.  "It's so heavy for such a tiny thing!  What metals must be found within!"
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID=For hours, he works the forge.  Finally, he presents you with a massive, gleaming blade.

SKAAL_WYRMESWRAEC_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Skaal's face darkens.  "I see.  A wyrm, now gone, retreating deeper into the earth.  Surely it seeks more power."
SKAAL_WYRMESWRAEC_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="If you follow it, you will need protection.  Take this shield - Thengil's finest, and a ward against dragonfire."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START_SID="In myth," recalls the caravan master, "the faerie folk lived in their underground hall, Cithriel, laughing and feasting."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START2_SID="Cithriel is no myth, though empty since the faerie folk left this world, everything left just so in memory of our ancestors."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START3_SID="But recently, a menace: demons from the black plains, horrors from the cosmos, led and bound by five black-marked summoners."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START4_SID="Destroy them!" bellows the caravan master.  "Slay those hateful wizards, and let Cithriel fade from the memory of man."

CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Slay the five summoners deep in the halls of Cithriel
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_REMINDER_SID="Within Cithriel, there are five summoners.  Destroy them, so as to banish their black magics from that place."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START_SID="You have done so much for us," the caravan master says gravely, "And yet, I must ask you for one more thing."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START2_SID="You have heard of Elfenwael?  Our black day?  The giants met us in battle, and scattered our people - this much is known."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START3_SID="Less known is how: four brothers entered the Underworld, and sold their souls, gaining great powers in exchange for walking the world above."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START4_SID="Weyg, Rhone, Carne, and Phole - their names are known to us, and cursed.  They guard the mouth of the underworld, the lake known as the Caldera."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START5_SID="It is in the dwarf lands, in the far north-west.  They guard the entrance, a dark, murky lake shrouded by fog, surrounded by rock and shale."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START6_SID="My people are gone now.  We are their pale, thin shadow.  But you can avenge them, adventurer.  Slay the giants!  Cast them to the world below!"
