RACE_4_SHORT_DESC=Snake-headed creatures from fens and moors
RACE_4_DESC=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.  The resultant creatures horrified the world: standing nearly as tall as a man, the creatures had the scales and head of an enormous snake, with the remaining features human in appearance.  Cast to the fringes of the world, the snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.

RACE_8_ABRV=Og
RACE_9_NAME=Giant
RACE_9_SHORT_DESC=Descendents of those that waged war against the fae
RACE_9_DESC=Though they are often seen as creatures of chaos by the unfamiliar, Giants are even older than the elves, and warred with the faerie folk when the world was still young.  Massive and tremendously strong, they stand three times as tall as the tallest man.  They live in the outer reaches of the world, where their settlements are constantly under attack by goblins and ogres, whom they hate. Giants prefer large, stone clubs, though when these are unavailable, a small tree will often do.

RACE_10_DESC=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.

CLASS_12_SHORT_DESC=Scholars of ancient knowledge
CLASS_12_DESC=Sages are scholars.  They study the seen and unseen to the exclusion of all else.  Sages are thin and frail.

THRALL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thrall
THRALL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thrall
THRALL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thrall stares at you with burning, lifeless eyes.
THRALL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thralls are undead made from the fresh corpses of the recently fallen. They resemble their former selves, though the colour of the skin fades, becoming a sickly yellow to grey.  Lacking the coordination of the living, they move slowly, but lose none of their former strength.  Due to the ease of animation, they are popular slaves and guards to black wizards, often carrying large axes to great effect.
SPOOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spook
SPOOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spook
SPOOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wispy, transparent patch of light, barely visible to the naked eye, the spook is a malevolent and mischievous spirit, often thought to be the remaining spirit of a child or half-wit.  Spooks crash about, creating a terrible noise.  They rampage through villages, breaking pots and pitchers, knocking clothes off lines, and harassing animals.  They rarely stay in one place long, causing brief havoc and then leaving before the residents can summon their wizard or priest.
SPOOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spook makes a terrible racket.
CHARCOAL_BURNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=charcoal burner
CHARCOAL_BURNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a charcoal burner
CHARCOAL_BURNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the forests around civilization, the charcoal burners ply their trade.  Clearing paths through the woodlands, they make great piles of wood, and then slowly burn them from within to create charcoal.  The wood-piles must be watched constantly to ensure the burn is at the correct rate; to do so, charcoal burners set up small huts nearby, where they live temporarily, catching sleep where they can.  When the process is complete, the charcoal is sold to the local villages, the burners pocketing their pittance before they return to the forests to watch their fires once more.
CHARCOAL_BURNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The charcoal burner nods at you.
WRECKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wrecker
WRECKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wrecker
WRECKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wreckers specialize in the retrieval of goods from shipwrecks; when there are none to be found, they will set about drumming up business.  Setting up false lights on rocky shorelines, wreckers lure ships into shoals to incapacitate the ship.  Once this is done, the crew of wreckers will move in by rowboat, deal with the crew appropriately, and then repossess the goods.  Given the general unpopularity of this practice in coastal communities, however, some wreckers need to move inland to avoid justice, and supplement wrecking with thievery and other criminal practices.
WRECKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wrecker grins at you, his teeth chipped and yellow.
WOODSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=woodsman
WOODSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a woodsman
WOODSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Woodsmen live apart from civilization.  Having chosen a life of solitude, they live deep in forests, cutting down trees, tending to the woods, and making a living off the land.  They are strong and tough, living in small caves or under lean-tos, snaring rabbits and hunting deer.  Those that live near elven woods are typically friendly with their sylvan neighbours.  They will cut down trees for the elves, and in return, receive useful tools such as bows, arrows, or long hunting-spears.  The less solitary woodsmen will sometimes even spend time with the wood-elves, sharing their food and learning a few words in the elven tongue.
WOODSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The woodsman grunts at you.
XITHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=xither
XITHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a xither
XITHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A lesser extradimensional creature, the xither most closely resembles a starfish.  Its five tendrils connect to form a point, but little else.  Its body seems to be formed of darkness, or some kind of dimming of the light.  They are, as best anyone can tell, almost purely reactive, showing little signs of intelligence.  Despite this, xithers are popular among wizards as familiars, being otherworldly but also requiring little to no upkeep when compared to the traditional choices such as toads, cats, and rats.
XITHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The xither rears back on one of its inky tendrils.
KALATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kalath
KALATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kalath
KALATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mistaken by many as the embodiment of a spirit, a kind of will o' the wisp, the kalath is actually something much more ancient.  Residing on higher dimensions of existence, kalathi are small, intense balls of light.  Normally docile, when cornered, kalathi attack with bursts of pure electricity, powerful shocks that can stun or even kill.
KALATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kalathi crackles and pops.
MIRSHI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mirshi
MIRSHI_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mirshi
MIRSHI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A lesser extra-terrestrial being, the mirhi does not appear to have a physical form, but manifests itself in the world as a shimmering ball of force.  Capricious and wildly unpredictable, mirshi strike with the force of an unseen mace or hammer.  Sages and sorcerors consider them unsuitable for familiars, as a number of ambitious spellcasters have been found dead, bruised and bleeding, after attempting to bind a mirshi to their will.
MIRSHI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mirshi shimmers and dances.
BOG_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bog spirit
BOG_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bog spirit
BOG_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The nomads that live near marshes tell of strange lights that appear quickly, shifting quickly.  Spirits of the dead that coalesce with marsh gas and foul air, bog spirits are often found in fens and wetlands, but are restless, and often wander elsewhere.  Bog spirits attack by enveloping, cloaking their victims in a cloud of acidic gases, floating away from a small pile of bones and armour.
BOG_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A strange hissing sound rushes from the bog spirit.
FORK_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fork bug
FORK_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fork bug
FORK_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, scuttling insect, the fork bug grows to the size of a grown man's hand.  They are so-named for two reasons: first, for their razor-sharp pincers, capable of piercing the thickest steel; and second, for their alarming ability to instantly split and regrow a perfect copy.  Many a hapless adventurer has looked back in a seemingly endless dungeon, only to find a swarm of bright green insects approaching like a rising tide.
DIVINE_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=divine spirit
DIVINE_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a divine spirit
DIVINE_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Divine spirits are the ghosts of the most holy - priests, martyrs, saints.  They inhabit holy sites such as the ruins of churches and temples.  Held to the earth by their faith, divine spirits help out travellers and the devout, while lashing out at the wicked.  Eventually, they are called to the heavens by the Nine, granted leave of the earth for the promises of the life beyond.
DIVINE_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The divine spirit whispers something in an ethereal language.
PUCA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=puca
PUCA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a puca
PUCA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A mischievous, shapeshifting creature, the puca is said to take many forms.  It often appears as a common animal such as a cat, songbird, or billy goat, but can also morph and appear mostly human.  When it does so, it is typically imperfect, retaining some measure of its previous form: cat-ears, perhaps, or a bit of plumage.  The puca is said to be unspeaking.  Although it is known to laugh, it is not known whether it can talk, and if it can, its voice has never been heard.
PUCA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The puca laughs gaily.
TENTACLED_SPIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tentacled spider
TENTACLED_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tentacled spider
TENTACLED_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A magical creation whose genesis is lost to history, tentacled spiders are similar to tarantulas in size.  However, they lack an arachnid's legs.  In place, they have a writhing mass of tentacles, which they use to propel themselves at great speed.  They possess a powerful poison, disproportionately strong for their size, and their aggressive nature makes them greatly feared.
TENTACLED_SPIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tentacled spider squelches and chitters.
FIRE_SPIRIT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire spirit
FIRE_SPIRIT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire spirit
FIRE_SPIRIT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers of the Nine believe that the manner of one's life and subsequent death determines one's ultimate course.  Those of clean conscience pass quickly into the next life, but those with fetters are forced to wander as spirits.  It is believed that the particularly vicious and angry become trapped after death, their rage and spiritual essence distilled until it burns like fire.  Fire spirits are said to be these people: violent, anguished, and destructive, they take delight in pain and suffering, eager to attack any living creature that should cross their path.
FIRE_SPIRIT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire spirit howls and rages.
GARGOYLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gargoyle
GARGOYLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gargoyle
GARGOYLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Lesser demons from the black plains, gargoyles resemble the grotesque creatures that decorate castles and palaces.  Standing somewhere between the height of a child and a man, gargoyles walk slowly, with a pronounced hunch.  Their skin is a dull grey, and very hard, resembling stone.  They are not unintelligent, but come to decisions slowly.  But once they make up their minds, they act decisively, and with a forceful stubbornness.
GARGOYLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gargoyle regards you stiffly.
BOAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=boar
BOAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a boar
BOAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wilder, larger versions of the domesticated pig, boars range in shape and size.  Some are barely larger than a dog, while others, left unattended, can grow to the size of a small pony.  They are adaptable creatures, living in fields, forests, near or far from civilization.  They are omnivores, typically eating vegetation, but also happy to scavenge, or even attack other mammals in certain circumstances.
BOAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The boar grunts and snorts.
PALLAS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pallas
PALLAS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pallas
PALLAS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=After receiving both martial and religious training in Atua-Elar, Pallas turned his back on his mountain elf brethren.  Rejecting The Lady to join the Black Ogre's hordes, he wanders the world, leaving a steady trail of death and destruction in his wake.  Abnormally tall for an elf, standing a full six and a half feet, some have whispered that surely he must have some Ogre or Giant in his lineage.  He wears a combination of hides and scraps of mail, and strapped to his back, a great sword - a heavy, ugly thing that he brings to bear with ferocity and hate against everything in his way.
PALLAS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Pallas grimaces at you, his eyes two shards of ice.
GRUBB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Grubb
GRUBB_DESCRIPTION_SID=Grubb
GRUBB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most goblins are short, nimble, and cunning.  Grubb is none of these things.  Large, lumbering, slow, and incredibly stupid, Grubb nonetheless maintains a goblin's love of senseless and terrifying violence.  Walking with a permanent limp, he carries with him a very large, very sharp knife.  This he puts to use at every opportunity: against wildlife, livestock, and just about anything slower than him.
GRUBB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Grubb exclaims, "What!"
SHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shale
SHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Shale
SHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A whisper-thin wood elf, Shale takes her adventuring name from her mottled, dark grey cloak.  Imbued with some kind of protective magic, it seems to waver slightly in the light, and allows her to blend very well against the dimness of dungeon walls.  Smart enough, Shale has mastered a few spells, and uses them to great effect, summoning healing energies when wounded, and conjuring great puffs of flame.  Her prized possession is her long knife.  Ash-handled, iron-bladed, it seems to smoulder when it cuts the air.
SHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Shale screams, "Eat flaming death, adventurer!"
WULF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wulf
WULF_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wulf
WULF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An adventurer from the tribe of the Isenlings, Wulf dresses for the harsh climate of his people.  Over top of his boiled leather armour he wears a cloak of wolf and bear skins, and underneath, heavy wool clothes.  He carries as well a long, balanced spear, which doubles as a staff: a quick learner, Wulf has picked up a number of cantrips and hedge magics during his travels, which he uses with cunning efficiency.
WULF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Wulf exclaims, "Hwaet!"
KITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kith
KITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kith
KITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wandering priest, Kith is a snakeling cast out of the Snake Lands for his heretical views on the divine.  Unlike the rest of his race, fervent followers of the dark three, Kith is a devout priest of the Trickster.  Taking a severe interpretation of the Trickster's religious texts, Kith attempts to bring balance by way of the sword, slaying good and evil alike in his quest to bring stability to the world.
KITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kith hisses, "With your death, some balance shall be restored to this world!"
BEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bel
BEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bel
BEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in loose, dirty clothing, Bel looks more like a beggar or pauper than a known thief and scoundrel.  But that is perhaps his purpose: masking his fae features by some sort of glamour, he stands a little over five feet tall, skinny, his hair wild and matted with leaves.  Over the top of his right boot pokes the handle of a slim knife.  Despite his short stature his voice is deep and rich, the sort of bass coveted by the great choirs of the churches to Celeste.  It is likely, though, given his long list of crimes, that that is a career he is not likely to choose anytime soon.
BEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Bel grins and laughs.
GILIRIEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gilirien
GILIRIEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gilirien
GILIRIEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Filled with wanderlust at a young age, Gilirien left the forests of her people to study magic in the central lands, apprenticing with the great wizards.  Excelling quickly, she shot through the ranks and earned her staff.  But rather than settle in a community as their wizard, she chose to wander the world instead.  For as much as she loves magic, she loves treasure even more.  Underneath her simple robes she wears an ancient mail coat.  Tucked into her belt is an old dwarven dagger, infused with magic.  She lugs about her treasures in an old leather backpack, carrying the contents of her life on her back, never staying for long.
GILIRIEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Gilirien conjures a wisp of flame at the end of his staff.
BRIMMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Brimman
BRIMMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Brimman
BRIMMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the human tribesmen from the far-flung outer isles, Brimman was formerly a sailor working a whaling boat to bring home winter meat.  But his vessel capsized, and all the men drowned - all save Brimman.  His dreams were terrifying, filled with visions of cold blackness, undersea terrors, and the voice of the White Queen, Shiver.  He woke up days later, parched, hypothermic.  Though he survived, his life came at a terrible cost: endless servitude to the White Queen, preaching her cold words wherever he went.  In exchange for this, Shiver gifted him with ancient magics, allowing Brimman to summon terrifying winds and cold.
BRIMMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Brimman hisses, his voice salty and cold.
HORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hord
HORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hord
HORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great, black-skinned ogre, Hord stoops low with a permanent hunch, his hands almost brushing the ground.  Despite his slow shamble, Hord's name is known throughout the outer lands, spoken with a combination of reverence and fear.  The goblins call him headcrusher, for his favourite method of dealing with dissent; his fellow ogres call him bonebreaker, for his love of marrow.  But everyone calls him dangerous, and nobody calls him stupid, for unlike many of his race, he possesses a keen mind.  He wears a set of custom-made, plated armour, and though he carries no weapon, it is said that his fists carry more weight than the greatest mace or sword.
HORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hord growls and spits, revealing a mouth of broken teeth.
FILCH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Filch
FILCH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Filch
FILCH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall gnomish man, standing a full four and a half feet tall, Filch's startlingly bright eyes glitter from beneath the hood of his cloak.  Dressed simply in a dark green tunic, he wears an array of knives and small swords at his belt.  A masterful thief, it is said that he once scooped a cup from a dragon's hoard, and lived to tell the tale, though the wrath of the dragon was great, and for the nearby islanders, the story ended very poorly indeed.
FILCH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Filch grins at you. "Good day to you!"
MYRDIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Myrdin
MYRDIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Myrdin
MYRDIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A celebrated dwarven hero, Myrdin is said to have boarded a raiding ship and killed every ogre aboard.  His appearance is striking: a braided brown beard, a thick mail coat, and a shield nearly as tall as he.  In his left hand he holds a great falchion, its blade inscribed with some sort of runic writing.  It gives off a soft green glow.  Unlike many dwarves, who prefer an unadorned or horned helmet, Myrdin wears a bronze helm crested with horse-hair, reminiscent of the warriors of the vanished empires.
MYRDIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Myrdin salutes you with his falchion.
ALTEUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alteus
ALTEUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alteus
ALTEUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Champion of the giants, standing a full fifteen feet tall, Alteus looks less mortal than divine.  His face is impassive and unreadable, his legs covered with scarred bronze greaves.  Perhaps due to his tremendeous height, he wears little other armour.  In his hands, he holds a lance as long a dragon, tipped with a fearsome, leaf-shaped blade.
ALTEUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alteus laughs, a deep belly-laugh that is impossible to ignore. "Ahahaha!"
LAYAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Layal
LAYAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Layal
LAYAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A member of the central desert tribes, Layal has many nicknames.  Whirlwind, Sandstorm, White Death - these are the names given to her both by her people, and her enemies.  Dressed in a billowing shirt and pants, a scimitar tucked into her belt, she moves with incredible grace and speed.  Often seen with her horse, a white charger, she strikes quickly, cutting through her enemies and then galloping away.
LAYAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Layal growls and says something in a harsh, guttural tongue.
BAGRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bagra
BAGRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Bagra
BAGRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Known in whispers as "the Black Fae", Bagra is an ancient, stooped crone.  Wearing a tattered black robe, her back severely bent, she bears the bleeding, black mark on her forehead.  One of Sceadugenga's favoured, she has been touched by him, and bears eternal corruptions.  A mass of inky blackness writhes where her tongue should be, her voice hisses and twists like a snake, and she works terrible blood magics that require the exsanguination of the innocent.  She is very old, known to old tales and poems.  She is drawn on the cover of the Black Book, an ancient tome of horrifying magic, as a stooped woman devouring a child.  To the northern tribesman, she is "Mortla", the snow that drifts on corpses.  And to her own people, she is an exile, her name never to be spoken again.
BAGRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Bagra hisses open-mouthed, and you see a churning mass of blackness within.
ALCIEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alcien
ALCIEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alcien
ALCIEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great knight of the church, the champion of Celeste, Alcien was a simple priest before receiving his greater calling.  The rector of a tiny log church nestled in the northern boreal forests, he received a vision from Celeste and began his martial path.  He has acted as pilgrim and punisher, restoring ancient holy sites, and bringing the blade to marauding monsters and horrors.  He wears a suit of the finest elven mail, and strapped to his back is a huge greatsword, a gift from his goddess in reward of his devotion.  
ALCIEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alcien draws his blade, and it erupts with holy light.
RUKHALA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rukhala
RUKHALA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rukhala
RUKHALA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When parents tell their children of Sceadugenga, and the horrors of the black god, they invoke a single name to terrify their children: Rukhala.  Black priest, highest of his kind, he acts as envoy of the eldritch horror.  He stalks the outer lands, razing entire villages as sacrifices to his dark god.  Appearing as a small, thin man, with a neatly trimmed beard and a piercing stare, he is said to dress well, have a soft, high voice, and impeccable manners.  But wherever he goes, a black wind follows.  Scented with death spices, the smell of this is a sure portent of one's coming death.
RUKHALA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=As Rukhala walks, you hear the sound of a low, heavy wind - sweet, and scented with sickly spices.
QUIVERING_BLOB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quivering blob
QUIVERING_BLOB_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quivering blob
QUIVERING_BLOB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, semi-solid gelatinous creature, quivering blobs attack with small bursts of electricity.  With this, they are able to paralyze their prey, and then envelop them.  Unlike some other jellies, which are more acidic, the process of digestion for quivering blobs is much slower.  As a result of this, one can often see creatures within the blob, slowly being eaten away by its weak digestive acids.
QUIVERING_BLOB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quivering blob wibbles at you threateningly.
GIANT_TOAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant toad
GIANT_TOAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant toad
GIANT_TOAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mottled brown and green, giant toads can grow almost as tall as a man.  While they are slow-moving, they are certainly capable of defending themselves.  Able to spit up to ten feet away, giants toads loose an acidic fluid so strong that it can eat through armour and bone.  Their diet is primarily insects and small mammals, but small piles of pitted weapons and armour have been found deep in marshes, and it has long been suspected that giant toads have had a role to play.
GIANT_TOAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant toad croaks.
GIANT_FROG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant frog
GIANT_FROG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant frog
GIANT_FROG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Slightly smaller than the giant toad, the giant frog shares its ability to spit fluids.  But while the giant toads spittle is acidic and dissolving, the giant frog's is poisonous.  Possessing a venom as powerful as a viper's, the giant frog is able to cover its victims in its poison, and patiently wait for the venom to be absorbed.  Once in the bloodstream, the poison acts quickly, killing the creature and allowing the frog to devour it slowly, at its leisure.
GIANT_FROG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant frog ribbits.
CRONE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=crone
CRONE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a crone
CRONE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tales tell of a bent and hobbled creature, a cloaked spirit that stalks the living-lands, a crone, though that name defiles the living.  Its voice is said to be that of an old woman, but its touch is from the deepest hells.  Piercing the thickest armour, it is said to inflict all manner of blights.  As a result, crones are deeply feared; thankfully, owing to their slow speed, they are also quickly outpaced.
CRONE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The crone is speechless beneath her wispy cowl.
SHAPESHIFTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shapeshifter
SHAPESHIFTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shapeshifter
SHAPESHIFTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Minor demons possessing some basic magical powers, shapeshifters walk among men and take their forms.  Though from the black plains, shapeshifters are not always malevolent; some take a liking to the places in which they live, and help out those around them.  But others are not so kind, and use their powers for evil.  Taking the form of something pleasing - a beautiful girl, a handsome young man - they use their powers to get near their victims before unleashing a sudden and savage attack.
SHAPESHIFTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shapeshifter grins at you, its mouth bursting with teeth.
KNIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=knight
KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a knight
KNIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When it comes to war, status means everything.  The majority of those called up to serve their king are simple peasant farmers, quickly made into infantry, given a basic spear or axe and little hope.  There are those who have served, or whose families have served, with distinction in the past, and these men are honoured accordingly.  Made knights, given rank and land, they enter battle with mail or plate, a sturdy shield, and a well-balanced blade.  A trained knight is no match for a band of simple spearman, able to quickly parry their clumsy attacks and tear into them with his long sword.
KNIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The knight hails you.
CRUSADER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=crusader
CRUSADER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a crusader
CRUSADER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The kings of the world have their favoured warriors, their knights, who can be worth twenty or more soldiers on the battlefield.  The more organized orders of the Nine saw this, and set about creating their own divine defenders.  From this came the crusaders.  Selected early for their strength and faith, crusaders receive both martial and theological training.  More studied than a priest and more powerful than a king's knight, crusaders are admired - and feared.  Given a mandate to seek out and destroy the enemies of their order, they are armoured in warded plate, and armed with holy blades.
CRUSADER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The crusader salutes you.
NAGA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=naga
NAGA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a naga
NAGA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Serpent-demons of the black plains, nagas combine the upper body of a man or woman with the body of a snake.  They possess a great strength, using their tail to crush and constrict, able to lift and throw small boulders.  Though they have a human mouth, they are either unable to unwilling to talk, and tales have been told of nagas enduring great wounds in combat without so much as a single scream.
CAVE_BEAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave bear
CAVE_BEAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave bear
CAVE_BEAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be a distant cousin of the great grizzly bears that roam the old forests, cave bears live deep within mountain caves, emerging to hunt mountain goats and other creatures.  Standing even taller than the grizzly, the cave bear can grow to a height of nine feet.  They are so strong, and their claws so tough, that they have been known to leave massive gouges in stone.  Despite their size and ferocity, they typically leave people well-alone, preferring the more docile goats, but they have been known to emerge from the mountains in hard times when food is scarce.
CAVE_BEAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave bear growls menacingly.
SWORD_EATER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sword-eater
SWORD_EATER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sword-eater
SWORD_EATER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Powerful, semi-intelligent oozes that can be found throughout the world, sword-eaters are nearly transparent, having only the smallest traces of opacity.  Their name derives from their intense acidity; when they envelop a sword or other object, their acids are able to corrode it to the point of uselessness within several minutes.  Though this makes them dangerous to the unwary, they are slow-moving, and can typically be outpaced very easily.
ROCK_CRAWLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock crawler
ROCK_CRAWLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock crawler
ROCK_CRAWLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Deep below the earth, within the rock itself, there live massive insects capable of burrowing through the rock itself.  These mindless insects are rock crawlers, and break down the rock with a combination of strong acids and powerful mandibles.  They normally feed on other insects, rats, and other small mammals, but will also attack dwarves, gnomes, and other cavern-dwellers if the opportunity arises.
LIVING_VINES_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=living vines
LIVING_VINES_DESCRIPTION_SID=the living vines
LIVING_VINES_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living vines have long been known by the world peoples.  Appearing at first to be a tangle of vines covering a rock or tree, they quickly lash out, constricting the creature and then slowly breaking it down to absorb its nutrients.  Because of this aggressive behaviour, living vines are rarely found near any kind of civilization, as farmers and peasants will carefully destroy them on sight, lest the vines be allowed to grow unchecked.
WITCHTHORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=witchthorn
WITCHTHORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the witchthorn
WITCHTHORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings have long lived away from society, persecuted for their innate powers.  Making their houses in forests or caves, away from those who would seek to harm them, witchlings often ring their homes with witchthorn.  This ancient plant is exceptionally dense and fast-growing plant has branches as hard as wood, and nasty, curved thorns.  Many poor adventurers have succumbed to their injuries after attempting to find a safe way over, victim to the many small and hidden thorns.
TREOW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=treow
TREOW_DESCRIPTION_SID=a treow
TREOW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thousands of years ago, in the deepest, darkest parts of the old forests, a powerful magic took hold.  The massive, old-growth trees uprooted and began to walk.  In a number of the old tongues, these trees were called "treow", an ancient word for tree.  The number of treow seems to have remained constant over the years, and it is thought that some magical process still animates ancient trees and grants them mobility.  Treow are unspeaking, but not unintelligent, fearsome fighters quick to exploit an opponent's weakness.  They slash and pound with their branches, and fear fire more than anything else.
TANGLEWEED_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tangleweed
TANGLEWEED_DESCRIPTION_SID=the tangleweed
TANGLEWEED_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A short, woody plant with thin, razor-sharp hairs, tangleweed grows naturally almost anywhere.  Typically growing four to five inches in height, its stem is bright green with small white spots, and its hairs are almost invisible to the naked eye.  It seems to react aggressively to disturbances, sending its hairs spinning and slashing.  Because of the thinness and sharpness of the hairs, the plant can be quite dangerous, causing heavy bleeding as the hairs become lodged in the skin.
DRAKHEEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drakheen
DRAKHEEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drakheen
DRAKHEEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=First named by the nomads of the great central deserts, the drakheen are dragon-like demons who walk upright like men.  When angered, they are known to breathe a deep, green fire.  However, the wings on their back appear useless; of the recorded reports of drakheen, none have ever mentioned flight.  Intensely intelligent, drakheen appear able to speak to any man in his native tongue, fluently and without accent.  Throughout history, there have been wizards who have attempted to summon and subsequently bind drakheen to their will, in an attempt to learn their secrets.  In each case, the history records the wizard as being enslaved, dragged down into the depths of the black plains for their hubris.
DRAKHEEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drakheen watches you intently, its expression smouldering.
WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wraith
WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wraith
WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The souls of powerful men forced to wander as spirits, wraiths are insubstantial, appearing at first glance as cloaked men.  But their cloaks are only darkness, and beneath that darkness is a pair of eyes, burning red with hate.  Powerful night-hunters, they can pass easily through wood and stone in pursuit of the living.  Unlike some undead, who show an affinity for unholy magics, wraiths do not appear to have any skill at this; instead, their touch is colder than death, drawing the souls from the living to the gates of the underworld.
WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wraith hisses, "Thin sawol is min, cild!"
SORCEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sorceror
SORCEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sorceror
SORCEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings are those able to harness the energies of the universe, the cold, shadowy magics born from the stars.  But there are those who are able to derive magical power from the world itself, and these men and women are sorcerors.  They can call upon the heavens to strike with lightning, conjure fire from the air, and summon frost and snow.  Though less hated than witchlings, sorcerors are nonetheless deeply distrusted, and many take up a wanderer's life, wending their way from town to town.  But it is said that all accidents are the work of sorcery, all bad luck, and so a sorceror's stay is never long.
SORCEROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sorceror murmurs a few words, and his staff begins to glow.
WIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wight
WIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wight
WIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among those who follow the dark arts, it has long been known that the quality of a corpse determines its quality in unlife.  Among the recently dead, ordinary peasants are raised as thrall.  But when dark magics take hold of the particularly violent and vicious, the murderous and psychotic, the result is a wight.  After death, their strength and savagery is multiplied ten-fold.  Imbued with terrible strength, they are known to tear apart their victims, and then crack the skull and bones to feast on brain and marrow.
WIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wight hisses something in a black tongue.
STEEL_GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=steel golem
STEEL_GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a steel golem
STEEL_GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Golems are traditionally made of clay, the result being a behemoth of a man under the complete control of its creator.  But the use of clay is only traditional, and not required.  When shaped of precious steel, the golem created is terrifying indeed.  Standing near twice as tall as a man, steel golems creak and gleam, noisy, but nearly unstoppable.  When they strike, they do so with more force than the strongest hammer, shattering rock and stone.  
PIRRHA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pirrha
PIRRHA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Pirrha
PIRRHA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thin and frail-looking, Pirra has a rather ordinary appearance.  His high cheekbones and sunken cheeks lend a gaunt expression, but his movements are quick; very quick.  Underneath the dirty cloak, several knives of varying lengths are tucked into his belt.  His eyes, a very dark brown, look to have some kind of darkness in them, an ugly, inky murk that roils as he speaks.
PIRRHA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A thin smile spread across Pirrha's face. "These bones are for the glory of our black lord. I think yours should do well, too!"
WISPE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wispe
WISPE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Wispe
WISPE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, non-descript man, Wispe looks to be hovering somewhere around middle age.  His black hair is greying, his beard streaked with white, but despite these signs of age, his eyes are still piercing and unsettling.  In taverns, he is mentioned quietly, and only briefly: he seems friendly, folk say, but his travelling companions disappear; there is something chilling behind the man.  From the top of his right boot protrudes the pommel of a thin blade.
WISPE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Wispe looks at you and allows himself a very small smile.
WILL_O_THE_WISP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=will o' the wisp
WILL_O_THE_WISP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a will o' the wisp
WILL_O_THE_WISP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At night, lights can often be seen over marshes and fens, strange flickerings that come and go.  Modern scholars agree that most of these are related to the eruption of certain gases present in the swamp.  However, this explanation does not satisfy the claims of some survivors of being followed and attacked by strange lights, not just in marshes, but in fields, forests, and even caves.  Most agree that the latter are released spirits of the dead, souls that attack the living with burts of magic and light.  Also known as "faerie lights", will o' the wisps are exceedingly weak and nimble.  It is said that a couple of sword-thrusts are sufficient to extinguish them, though actually landing a blow can be problematic.
WERELIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=were-light
WERELIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a were-light
WERELIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing first to the eye as distant torch-light, were-light is in fact something far older.  At some point in the distant past, ancient beings descended from the stars to the earth.  And so strong was their will that when their mortal bodies passed, their spirits condensed into blazing balls of light.  Changing in colour, they flicker from orange to green, blue to white, crackling with intense, electro-telluric power.
GRAVE_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=grave worm
GRAVE_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a grave worm
GRAVE_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the ecosystem of decomposers, scholars have produced a great list of small, seemingly insignificant creatures that break down living matter.  But there is another creature, much larger, that performs this task, and this is the massive grave worm.  A long, green worm reaching the length of a man's leg, this worm breaks down plant and animal matter quickly with its powerful acids.  It lives deep underground, and is most typically found as an unpleasant surprise when exhuming the recently dead, writhing through flesh and bone.
BLACK_SERVANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black servant
BLACK_SERVANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black servant
BLACK_SERVANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers of Sceadugenga are ostracized at best; often, they are killed outright, for fear of the horrifying powers sought.  But all bear a distinctive mark: a dull black mark on the forehead, that slowly bleeds from the edges.  Black servants are granted the black corruption, allowing them to petrify the living things that they touch.  These powers, and the psychosis that accompanies them, force black servants to the fringes of society.  Walking the woods and forests, they live in caves and caverns, spreading their corruption and hoping to learn more of the black secrets of the universe.
BLACK_SERVANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black servant hisses a response, its words ugly and seething.
CARAVAN_MASTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=caravan master
CARAVAN_MASTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the caravan master
CARAVAN_MASTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A handsome man, regal and impossibly old, the caravan master is one of the few fae remaining who walks the world.  Dressed in fine silks of green, blue, and brown, his movements are quick and assured, his eyes piercing.  He has led his caravan for countless untold years since the fae began to vanish, moving from place to place, never staying long.  He carries all his possessions in a small caravan, a rickety covered wagon whose white paint has started to chip and peel.  It seems to be bursting with all manner of items.  Strange-looking swords and paintings share space with clothing and fine furs, and the smell of exotic spices fill the air.
CARAVAN_MASTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The caravan master laughs, his laughter echoing like music around you.
CARAVAN_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=caravan guard
CARAVAN_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a caravan guard
CARAVAN_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fae, being so few and foreign, are often distrusted.  When they brush up against civilization, they often find themselves receiving a chilly welcome - or worse.  Because of this, some of their number serve as guardsmen.  Clad in armour and wielding elemental magics, these guardsmen are well-trained, experienced, and capable of unleashing great destruction of the enemies of their caravans.
CARAVAN_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The caravan guard eyes you warily.
FAE_MUSICIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fae musician
FAE_MUSICIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fae musician
FAE_MUSICIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The fae, few that they are, are known to be great musicians.  All can play or sing something, and in the eternally-long lives of the fae, those that choose to devote their lives to music become very good indeed.  Practiced in all forms of music, fae musicians can sing and drum, play flutes, viols, and trumpets.  For many, their favourite instrument is a small, lute-like instrument called the "cith", which produces sweet, soft music that other musicians find incapable of duplication.
FAE_MUSICIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fae musician sings, "O cruel were his parents who sent my love to sea, and cruel was the ship that bore my love from me..."
FAE_TRAVELLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fae traveller
FAE_TRAVELLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fae traveller
FAE_TRAVELLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most fae are wanderers, travelling the wilderness in their pony-drawn caravans, staying for a season in ancient moorlands or forests before moving on.  Fae travellers typically do not carry weapons, but are certainly prepared for hostilities.  Having some knowledge of magic, they can attack with elemental forces, preferring to attack with frost and cold to slow their enemies, allowing an escape if necessary.  They prefer light, loose clothes, which always appear to be in immaculate condition - whether this is the case, or some sort of glamour, is uncertain.
FAE_TRAVELLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fae traveller hails you.
BLACK_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black priest
BLACK_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black priest
BLACK_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The Nine each bless their priests for their devotion and loyalty.  Normally, they grant wisdom, strength, or constitution; but Sceadugenga, the black horror, goes far beyond that.  His priests are granted insight and wisdom, but at a terrifying cost.  Their bodies become sickly and frail; their touch becomes death, inflicting the grey sickness; and their faces, beneath the heavy cowl of their robes, becomes insubstantial, a writhing mass of darkness punctuated by two hateful, burning eyes.
BLACK_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black priest fixes you with burning eyes, its face a mass of darkness beneath the cowl.
ANTLION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=antlion
ANTLION_DESCRIPTION_SID=an antlion
ANTLION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An enormous beast with the torso and tail of a lion and the head and limbs of a massive ant, the antlion is a terrifying predator.  It arrives seemingly out of nowhere, burrowing out of the ground.  Despite its huge size, it is relatively silent, emitting only a faint, chittering sound.  It attacks with its mandibles, stabbing and tearing, killing its prey before dragging it down beneath the earth.
ANTLION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The antlion chitters.
CAVE_TROLL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave troll
CAVE_TROLL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave troll
CAVE_TROLL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Larger and much more stupid than their surface-dwelling counterparts (who themselves sometimes inhabit caves), cave trolls grow to the size of giants, but are typically hunched over, due to the caverns they inhabit.  Those that live in the larger caves, though, do not have this hunch, and are imposing figures indeed.  Their skin is a rough grey, and they tend to wear the skins of whatever they can find - goat, bear, even dwarf.  They wield massive stalactites as clubs, able to destroy organs and shatter bone through even the strongest armour.
CAVE_TROLL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave troll growls and stares at you through squinted eyes.
STONE_OOZE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone ooze
STONE_OOZE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone ooze
STONE_OOZE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Deep in the darkest caverns and forests, a strange creature slithers.  The stone ooze is a magical jelly; slow, but deadly.  It has a powerful acid that can cause petrification.  The stone ooze uses this acid to great effect, petrifying its prey, and then slowly enveloping it.  Once it has completely surrounded the petrified corpse, it dissolves it, slowly, over a period of weeks.
FOX_MAIDEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox maiden
FOX_MAIDEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox maiden
FOX_MAIDEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is said that when foxes reach a certain age, they can take on human form.  Being tricksters, these fox-spirits often take the form of a beautiful, naked woman.  These fox maidens travel the world, captivating men and holding them spellbound.  Once the victim is fully captivated, the fox maiden attacks, savagely devouring the heart and brain while the victim still breathes.
FOX_MAIDEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox maiden smiles at you, her naked form captivating.
FIREBIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=firebird
FIREBIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a firebird
FIREBIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature of myth and legend, the firebird is a great bird born of flame and ash.  It is said that the firebird is eternal, and cannot be killed - each time that it is, it dies in a burst of flame, and then is immediately reborn.  It is a massive creature, larger even than the roc, with a wingspan of nearly a hundred feet.  Its feathers are red-yellow, and when the firebird takes flight, its feathers waver and ripple like an inferno.
FIREBIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The firebird shrieks.
DIRE_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dire wolf
DIRE_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dire wolf
DIRE_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The dire wolf is the largest of the canine species, larger than the great cats, and with only a little exaggeration, almost as large as a mammoth.  Dire wolves have a thick, silvery coat that allows them to blend in easily in arctic environments.  In fact, this is where they are most often found.  Their size and terrifying appearance has made them all but extinct in more populated areas; though the stray dire wolf can be found around civilization, they are most commonly found on the uninhabited outlying islands.  Dire wolves are popular, with lions, griffons, and the like, as symbols of royal houses, being featured on many coats of arms throughout history.
DIRE_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dire wolf growls, its entire body quivering and shaking.
CHAOS_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chaos beast
CHAOS_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chaos beast
CHAOS_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Little is known about the chaos beast because it changes so quickly that two scholars are rarely sure if they are discussing the same creature.  Its basic form is thought to be a huge beast, similar in size to a rhinoceros, covered in a dense, shaggy fur.  But due to some chaotic magic, this is rarely true for long: it adds and removes heads, appears as a small dragon, shifts into a griffon, and then changes again.  The chaos beast is savage, attacking ferociously regardless of size or number.  Usually in myth they are described as living deep in mountains, coming from the caves to lay waste to the world.
CHAOS_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chaos beast shimmers briefly.
FELL_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fell lord
FELL_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fell lord
FELL_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Each of the Nine has their favoured servants, and for Urgoth, these are the fell lords.  It is said that these are created from the spirits of lords who worship the Black Ogre, given eternal life in exchange for celestial servitude.  These shimmering creatures appear as massive men the size of ogres.  Fell Lords wear a lord's clothing and gold, and carry a massive, flaming sword.  They speak softly in a strange, astral language, whispering a few words before attacking with a savage fury.
FELL_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fell lord whispers something you cannot understand.
RED_LADY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=red lady
RED_LADY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a red lady
RED_LADY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Legends throughout the world tell of the Red Lady, a bloody woman in a red dress.  It is said that, after learning of an infidelity, the woman is overwhelmed and murders her husband, children, and then herself.  But such an affront to the Nine binds the soul to the earth.  The lady's spirit is forced to wander; and still filled with the same hateful rage as in her final moments, viciously attacks the unwary, her ghostly form still oozing and gushing impossible amounts of blood.  Her touch is ice and death, and she tears and rips with her jagged, uneven fingernails.
RED_LADY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Red Lady wails piteously, a shrill and piercing lament.
VOIDLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=voidling
VOIDLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a voidling
VOIDLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Beyond the world's edges, in space, there lurk creatures and horrors.  The voidlings are servants of Shiver.  They have no discernable physical appearance; rather, they appear as disturbances.  Light bends and twists around them, causing them to look like warps in reality.  They are accompanied by an intense, unearthly cold.  A voidling's touch drains heat, leaving only frozen husks behind.
VOIDLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The voidling reaches towards you, and you feel a sudden cold.
WITCH_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=witch king
WITCH_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a witch king
WITCH_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Witchlings work with the very magic the world is made of, and the most skilled are called witch kings.  These spellcasters are tremendously powerful, wielding the force of shadows to their ends, whether good or evil.  Prolonged exposure to this magic alters them, though; a witch king can always be identified by their eyes, black and unblinking.
WITCH_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The witch king stares at you through inky-black eyes.
BLACK_MONK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black monk
BLACK_MONK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black monk
BLACK_MONK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most of the religious orders preach poverty and service.  The monks of Celeste, Vedere, and others will often take a break from life at the monastery to walk the roads and trails, begging for food, and helping those they can.  But the monks of Sceadugenga have a different purpose: they wander the roads and fields, murdering those they meet.  These monks are granted great strength for their devotion, as strong as the greatest knight or soldier.  As such, they need little other than their hands to dispatch travellers.  Thankfully, they can be easily identified.  Black monks always wear a distinctive, light grey robe with a strange black sigil upon the front and back.
BLACK_MONK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black monk tenses as you speak.
BLACK_SUMMONER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black summoner
BLACK_SUMMONER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black summoner
BLACK_SUMMONER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black-cloaked, aged, the summoners of Cithriel are wizards from the central lands who have turned to the dark embrace of Sceadugenga.  Bearing the black, bleeding mark, they found in their ancient texts a reference to the ward used by the faerie folk to hide the entrance to Cithriel, their underground hall.  Bending the seal, they were able to enter, and found a place of greatly concentrated magic, a place where planes collide and where demons and horrors can be summoned and bound.  The summoners are bent double by their age, and walk by aid of their staves, but command a fearsome power, not nearly as frail as they seem.
BLACK_SUMMONER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black summoner hisses, "the living are naught but sacrifices to our lord Sceadugenga!"
VIREQUUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=virequus
VIREQUUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a virequus
VIREQUUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The minotaur is half-bull, half man; the virequus is literally the "man-horse".  A virequus stands taller than the minotaur, and is even more fearsome.  Its legs end in a horse's hooves, though it has human hands at the ends of its arms.  And, instead of a human head, it has a massive horse's head, full of rage and fury.  Virequus typically wield huge, spiked clubs, and have sometimes served as tomb guardians to ancient kings.
VIREQUUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The virequus snorts and stamps its feet.
GOLDEN_EAGLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golden eagle
GOLDEN_EAGLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a golden eagle
GOLDEN_EAGLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A huge and semi-mythical bird, the golden eagle is known as such for the distinctive, dark-gold colouring of the tips of the feathers.  Golden eagles perch atop mountains, watching the world below.  They swoop down to grab bears, caribou, and other huge mammals, feasting on them at the top of the world.  In the past, some sorcerors were known to talk to the eagles and be permitted to ride, but there have been no records of this succeeding in more than a thousand years; all known attempts have ended in quick and bloody failure.
GOLDEN_EAGLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The golden eagle shrieks.
STAR_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=star beast
STAR_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a star beast
STAR_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A race of creatures inhabiting the heavens, some say that star beasts live within the stars themselves.  Others say that star beasts are actually the expulsions of stars, sent during solar eruptions to punish the wicked.  On earth, solar beasts appear strange and terrifying: a constantly shifting form, almost semi-liquid, surrounded by a halo of intense, visible heat.  They fly through the air with ease, and anything in its way becomes little more than cinders and ash.
STAR_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The star beast burns with an unearthly fire, unspeaking.
KING_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=king slime
KING_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a king slime
KING_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=It is unknown just what causes king slimes to form - whether they naturally grow to their size, or they are the amalgamation of many smaller slimes.  They tend to live in moist areas, feeding by dissolving their prey with powerful acid and feasting on the nutrients.  Because of their size, they are easily spotted, and hunted ruthlessly.  As a result, they are often found far from civilization, feeding on mammals, birds, and insects.
KING_SLIME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The king slime wobbles threateningly.
WAR_MAMMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=war mammoth
WAR_MAMMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a war mammoth
WAR_MAMMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mammoths are dangerous enough on their own, having a thick hide, sharp tusks, and a quick temper.  But some cultures have managed to train mammoths, and some use them as a terrifying weapon of war.  Sporting massive metal plates and spikes, these war mammoths cut swaths through enemy soldiers.  Often, riders will be perched in a small, armoured box atop the mammoth's back, guiding the beast through quick, decisive motions.  But some have been trained to attack without a rider, following signals issued by a commander nearby.  These are often used as siege-breakers, single-mindedly attacking gates and walls, and ignoring the stones, arrows, and pitch.
WAR_MAMMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The war mammoth bellows.
BLACK_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black devil
BLACK_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black devil
BLACK_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Out of the depths of hell come the black devils.  Fire-breathing, dog-headed demons covered in blood and gore, they command companies of demons in the struggle of the factions of the black plains.  The black devils are savage and cunning.  Those who would tempt fate by attempting bargaining with them often find themselves dragged down into hell, forced to serve in the hellish hordes until their lives are extinguished.
BLACK_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black devil talks to you in a low voice, its demonic words impossible to decipher.
SCREAMER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=screamer
SCREAMER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a screamer
SCREAMER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Terrifying, quick spirits, screamers appear formless but briefly flash hateful expressions that some say resemble them in life.  They are described in a nursery rhyme: "Bali was a hateful man, Bali loved to lie.  Screamers came to take poor Bali's spirit when he died."  Nobody is sure what causes these spirits to remain on the earth, shrieking and wailing, but it is popularly assumed that the spirits cannot leave until the thing to which they are bound - a person, an object - has passed as well.
SCREAMER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The screamer emits a terrible shriek.
QUADRIGA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quadriga
QUADRIGA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quadriga
QUADRIGA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The cavalry of the black plains, the quadriga is a huge chariot borne by four demonic, black horses, driven by some kind of unseen force.  Larger even than draft horses, the black horses snort and spit with a hateful intensity.  They are lashed to the yoke and chariot by ropes of magical flame.  It is said that the appearance of a quadriga, while terrifying in and of itself, is a forerunner of something truly terrible indeed.
QUADRIGA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demonic horses rear up as one.
HELLHOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hellhound
HELLHOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hellhound
HELLHOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The guards of hell, hellhounds are enormous, multi-headed dogs.  Their fur is matted, ranging from light grey to coal-black, and from their mouth erupts great gusts of flame.  These demon-hounds are not intelligent, but possess a low cunning, and are very aggressive.  These hounds prowl the perimeter of the black plains, attacking any found in the outer lands, which are said to be the domain of these hellish dogs.
HELLHOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hellhound growls, spitting fire and flame.
SKYWING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skywing
SKYWING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skywing
SKYWING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The greatest beasts of the skies, skywings are distant kin of the dragons: larger, older, equally deadly.  Known as "black wraiths" to many, their wingspan is so great that it seems to dim the light, despite the enormous heights at which they fly.  Unable to breathe fire like their dragon-kin, they compensate with rows of bony, claw-like protrusions from their wings.  Emerging from great caverns to hunt at night, they are not picky about their diet, favouring anything large and living.  Their image is common on royal crests, and it is said that, like the dragons, they were once tamed by the greatest of men.
SKYWING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skywing flaps its wings once in response, releasing a gale-force wind.
PIT_FIEND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pit fiend
PIT_FIEND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pit fiend
PIT_FIEND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The pit fiend is said to live near the world's center, its movements the cause of earthquakes and tsunamis.  Its appearance is horrifying: the head of a massive insect, with thousands of eyes; the body of a great bear; the talons of a great raptor.  There is a known shard of ancient pottery, a large section of an amphora, that shows the destruction of Aras.  It is known that an earthquake destroyed the seaside town thousands of years ago; but recently, this shard of pottery was discovered a few hundred miles from the original site, buried in ancient mud.  It shows houses broken by earthquake, and a scene of carnage - and at its center, the horrifying pit fiend.
PIT_FIEND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pit fiend shrieks, a sound that splits the world.
HIGH_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=high wizard
HIGH_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a high wizard
HIGH_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the central lands, young boys and girls study the ancient teachings of magic.  After an apprenticeship period, if they are deemed worthy, they are granted their staff and cloak-clasp, each an unmistakable sign that they are now wizards.  Most then travel, taking their talents from town to town, where the local wizard is a combination in status of elder and sage.  But some choose not to travel, and stay at the great schools instead.  They spend their days teaching, cleaning, and doing other tasks, their evenings devoted to devouring the ancient texts of the great libraries.  The greatest of these are the high wizards, men and women who learn the deep secrets of ancient magics: how to transmute common materials, unleash elemental storms, and form protective wards.  The high wizards are guardians of the physical world, capable of fighting the incursions of demons and monsters, and the horrors of the celestial beyond.
HIGH_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The high wizard whispers a greeting to you, his voice brittle as old paper.
BARROW_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=barrow wyrm
BARROW_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a barrow wyrm
BARROW_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In days gone by, the histories make mention of the death of great kings.  Buried in full raiment, surrounded by gold and swords, their deaths were great celebrations, both of the life of the deceased, and of the king or queen to come.  But precious things call like a siren to dragonkind.  To some of these great tombs came great wyrms: barrow wyrms, strong enough to scatter a king's army before slithering back to hide beneath coins, cups, and mail.  Monstrous creatures, their scales a dull, inky green, barrow wyrms remain coiled beneath the crushing weight of their hoards, always poised, always alert.  Scholars belive barrow wyrms to be the most greedy of their kind, the greatest lovers of treasure, the most fond of gold.
BARROW_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The barrow wyrm shrieks and roars, and the earth trembles.
VIGARION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vigarion
VIGARION_DESCRIPTION_SID=Vigarion
VIGARION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the great heroes of faerie time, Vigarion accepted the exchange of eternal life for eternal service.  When the prison Eka was created, he grimly agreed that he would watch over the entrance for intruders, guarding it so that none might release the hellish denizens within.  Though his actual age is now unknowable, Vigarion appears to be just shy of middle age.  He wears armour that appears to be woven of threads of steel, giving it a shimmer that reflects in the light.  Strapped to his waist is a faerie sword, lightly curved, and he wears a round shield strapped to his back.
VIGARION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Vigarion hails you with his curved faerie sword.
DRACOSPAWN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dracospawn
DRACOSPAWN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dracospawn
DRACOSPAWN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=From the ancient marshes and fens come the dracospawns, ancient creatures of the same family as dragons.  They lack the legs and wings of the dragon, having a wyrm's huge, snakelike body.  But unlike the wyrm, which has a single head, the dracospawn have many, at least half a dozen.  And while the wyrms possess a deep intelligent equal or better than humans and elves, the dracospawns are animal-like, lacking speech or the capability for deep thought.  They are, however, exceptionally dangerous, deeply aggressive and aware of their elevated position in nature.  Each head can spit a powerful acid, and with each one working together, there is little in the world that can stand in their way.
DRACOSPAWN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dracospawn's many heads shriek, producing a terrible dissonance.
WEYG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Weyg
WEYG_DESCRIPTION_SID=Weyg
WEYG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of four brothers who journeyed to the underworld, Weyg is the unspoken leader of the four.  Tall, even by Giant standards, he wears a breastplate and winged helm, hefting a massive spear in one arm.  He moves deliberately and dangerously.  He wears sandals, and simple leg wrappings, with no protection below the waist.  His legs are bare and terribly scarred, bearing the wounds of untold battles.
WEYG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Weyg says something in a language lost to this world.
RHONE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rhone
RHONE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Rhone
RHONE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When four brothers journeyed to the underworld to learn the secrets required to quell the Fair Folk, they were granted great strength and skill, though at a terrible cost.  Bound to walk the earth forever, they determined to guard the entranceway from anyone who would seek the bargain they took.  Rhone is the youngest of these brothers, slight, a runt by giant standards at barely eight feet tall.  But though small, he is quick, and as skilled with the bow as any elven marksman.  He holds a massive ash bow, his quiver full of arrows made from the scraggy trees that surround the lake, each shaft feathered by the green-grey feathers of some long-extinct bird.
RHONE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Rhone regards you coolly.
PHOLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Phole
PHOLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Phole
PHOLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Second in age, first in mind, Phole could be said to be the catalyst behind Elfenwael: having discovered mention of a gateway to the underworld in oral histories, he worked tirelessly to finally pinpoint its whereabouts.  In the depths of the underworld, he was granted a devil's bargin, given ancient and powerful magics in exchange for a promise to be bound forever to the upper world, to walk endlessly and watch the ages pass.  But with his brothers, he decide to guard the entrance, using his terrible magics against any unwary adventurers who sail to the far corner of the world.
PHOLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Phole speaks a few unintelligible words.
CARNE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carne
CARNE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Carne
CARNE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Said to have the strength of two dragons, Carne stands almost as tall as one.  Well over thirty feet high, he wears plates of iron and steel inches several inches thick.  He carries an enormous, long-hafted hammer fashioned from an oak trunk and a rectangular boulder.  His face is misshapen, the result of so many crushing blows: a bent nose, a mass of scars, a burnt and mangled ear.  He does not speak, his tongue lost long ago for unknowable reasons; instead, he communicates via gestures, bleats, and hollers.
CARNE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Carne hollers mutely, his armour straining from the force of his rage.
AVERNAL_BAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=avernal bat
AVERNAL_BAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=an avernal bat
AVERNAL_BAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive creatures with a wingspan reaching thirty feet wide, avernal bats are found only around the strange lake in the dwarf-lands known as the Caldera.  Their fur is an odd blue-grey colour, and their eyes, it is said, are a bright and gleaming shade of red.  In ancient legend, the Caldera is said to be the path to the underworld, and avernal bats are widely seen as a warning to keep the living from straying into the world below.
AVERNAL_BAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The avernal bat shrieks.
MIST_WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mist wraith
MIST_WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mist wraith
MIST_WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the north-west part of the world lies an ancient lake, known as the Caldera.  Believed to be the mouth of the underworld, the Caldera is surrounded by a roiling, freezing mist.  Within this mist, there are shapes - vaguely human forms, cowled in tatters and rags, their voices whispering, calling.  These wraiths are heralds of the world beyond.  Stalking the lakelands, they look for travellers, for the heroic and foolish, and seek to hasten their journey to the second world.
MIST_WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mist wraith hisses from beneath its cowl.
WINDWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=windwalker
WINDWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a windwalker
WINDWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Given their name by the skraelings, who talk of them in hushed tones around late-night fires, the windwalkers are divine beings who stalk the cosmos, pausing occasionally to haunt and howl at the world.  Taking the form of shimmering, visible air, they appear as legless but otherwise roughly humanoid, with a pair of long, thin arms, and a contorted, screaming face.  Floating a few inches off the ground, they move quickly, surrounding their victims with a sudden, deadly cold.
WINDWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The windwalker's airy face contorts into a howl of unimaginable rage.
TARASQUE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tarasque
TARASQUE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tarasque
TARASQUE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Looking like something out of myth or legend, the tarasque is a strange combination of many fierce creatures.  It most closely resembles a dragon, being reptilian, but also has the shell of a giant tortoise, a tail that ends like a scorpion's, and a head that looks almost more human than reptilian.  Tarasques are intelligent; able to converse with men, they often surprise those who have come to hunt them, offering conversation before savagely attacking.  Their principal attack is a powerful poison, a paralytic delivered by the stinger at the tip of their tail.  Despite the inherent danger in these creatures, their shells are extremely valuable.  Harder than diamond, the shells are sometimes worked using magic to create the most beautiful and protective armours in the world.
TARASQUE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tarasque smiles at you, and returns the greeting.
TARO_WRAITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Taro wraith
TARO_WRAITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a Taro wraith
TARO_WRAITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many mythologies describe a path of the dead that leads to underworld - a black river, a whirlpool, a wretched pit.  One of the ancient empires, now passed from memory, described the path as "Taro", the road of the dead; on this road, the walking dead cast aside their bones, with their spirits passing to the world beyond.  But some of these spirits refuse to pass, and instead, turn back.  Powerful enough to escape the maw of death and travel back to the realm of the living, they nonetheless cannot cheat the Nine and return to life.  These Taro wraiths are deeply feared - their touch brings stumbling, confusion, and eventual petrification.  Legends tell of the great wyrm of Amar, who in her hubris challenged a Taro wraith.  Travellers found the wyrm petrified outside the entrance to her lair, and this great stone sentinel took hundreds of years to crumble under the elements and return to the earth.
TARO_WRAITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The Taro wraith responds to your hail, its voice ragged and thin.
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=clockwork monstrosity
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a clockwork monstrosity
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Created by some mad artificer, clockwork monstrosities are mentioned in ancient texts only in passing, as examples of myth and fancy.  Awkward, two-legged things that walk like a slow, flightless bird, they have two massive protusions that resemble battering rams.  Only, when these are slammed forward, it is as if there are a hundred men behind the force of the blow.  Clockwork monstrosities are made of unrusting iron a full foot thick, their rams tipped in diamond so as to break through even the hardest stone.
CLOCKWORK_MONSTROSITY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The clockwork monstrosity clicks and whirrs.
TIAMAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tiamat
TIAMAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tiamat
TIAMAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the great, ancient beasts, the tiamat is a fearsome creature, equally at ease in land, air, or water.  Possessing functional, dragon-like wings, and a reptilian head, it superficially resembles dragon-kin.  But besides this, the creatures are nothing alike, the tiamats far more ancient, and unrelated to the dragons.  Its scales closely resemble that of a fish.  The toes of a tiamat are webbed, and rows of gills line its neck.  These allow the tiamat to easily live underwater, which in fact they often do, occupying underwater caves and caverns.  But they can also breathe air, and some have been found making their homes deep in mountain ranges.  Tiamats, like dragons, have a terrifying breath weapon: unlike dragons, who spew fire and flame, the tiamats are able to unleash a horrifying cold, instantly freezing those who would dare come near.
TIAMAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tiamat fixes its gaze on you.
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient guardian
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ancient guardian
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Constructs more terrifying than the tallest golem, the guardians are shambling, six-armed creatures made of clay, rocks, feathers, glass - seemingly anything at hand.  Molded into a vaguely humanoid shape, they lack any facial features or expressions, their heads a jumbled assortment of materials, whimsically formed.  But imbued with magical existence, they exist for a singular purpose, guard a particular thing, and will stop at nothing should their domain be threatened.
ANCIENT_GUARDIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient guardian's faceless stare seems fixed on you.
WUMPUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wumpus
WUMPUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wumpus
WUMPUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Not much is known about the legendary wumpus.  Many adventurers have set off to hunt it (often with laughably few arrows), and none have returned.  It is assumed to be a great, yeti-like creature, but this is merely speculation, as it eats anything foolish enough to approach.
WUMPUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wumpus licks its chops.
OLD_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=old lord
OLD_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=an old lord
OLD_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In legend, an ancient group of lords led their men against a tribe of primitive men.  The lords led their men to victory, but at a terrible cost: a group of shamans cursed the lords, binding the spirits of the lords and shamans for eternity.  These fused spirits have the ghostly appearance of the lords themselves, but this is only the shell - the spirits are the shamans themselves, driven by the hatred of death and the slaughter of their people.  Over millennia, these spirits have grown in power, and are whispered about, feared, lest they should somehow appear.  Even the term "old lord" is borne out of this, a term careful not to name any of the shamans, or even mention the shamans themselves.
OLD_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The old lord's face draws back into a hateful glare.
STEEL_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=steel slime
STEEL_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a steel slime
STEEL_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A super-massive slime even larger than the king slimes, steel slimes are enormous, magical slimes that slither and crawl aggressively.  When threatened, they are able through some process to harden, forming a temporary shell that renders them very difficult to damage.  The shell that they form is harder than iron.  It has a strange sparkling quality that some say is due to magic, while more practical people suspect is due to the reaction of unstable acids.  Steel slimes have the most powerful acids of any slime, jelly, or ooze, able to corrode armour in an instant, searing flesh and bone alike.
STEEL_SLIME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The steel slime flashes silver and grey.
SKELETON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton
SKELETON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton
SKELETON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton fixes you with its soulless gaze.
SKELETON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skeletons are the bones of the dead infused with unholy magics to give them form once more.  The bones are weakly separated by magic.  Sudden movements cause the bounces to bounce and click, and combined with the scraps of armour buried with the dead, this lends skeletons a tell-tale clattering sound that serves to announce their presence.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal warrior's jaws clatter loudly.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Necromancy is only as good as the bodies it animates, and skeletal warriors are good bodies indeed.  The skeletal remains of warriors, soldiers, and mercenaries, the animation creates a skeleton that is cunning, quick, and absolutely lethal.  Skeletal warriors usually wear a few ill-fitting scraps of armour, their claw-like hands grasping a sword that remains as keen in death as it was in life.
MUMMY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mummy
MUMMY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mummy
MUMMY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mummy opens its mouth and you are assaulted by a thousand years of decay.
MUMMY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most things die, they are buried or burned, and their bodies return to the earth. Sometimes, though, the body can be preserved long after death, and then possessed by evil spirits who exert their will through the decaying form. These creatures are mummies, fearful things who shamble slowly but possess an incredible strength.
ARDU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ardu's voice is a sickly rasp, his words of a language lost to time.
ARDU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great warrior of a forgotten empire, Ardu was protector to a great line of kings until he was deeply wounded in battle.  After dying shortly thereafter, his spirit was captured by witch-magic, forced to forever protect the sanctity of the ancient tombs.
SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shade
SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shade
SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shade releases an anguished scream.
SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of the recent dead, shades are the corporeal shadows of corpses, imbued with unholy life.  Shades roughly resemble the person they once were, but with formless features.  Their eyes are a milky white, their skin soft and black, with a velvet-like texture.  The touch of shades is much feared: full of the essence of shadow and darkness, it can cause the petrification and slow death of its victims, leaving behind a stiff, almost statue-like corpse.
LICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lich
LICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lich
LICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lich murmurs, "Ic com on thisse blaec daeg for eower lif."
LICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lich is a fearsome creature, born from fusing black magic into the body of a great sorceror.  Years of death waste away the muscle tissue so that the skin stretches taught over nothing but bone.  And these years of unlife and study render the lich capable of unleashing terrible magics.  Cloaked in the tattered robes it wore in life, the lich's gaze is unmistakable, two embers burning beneath the shadow of the cowl.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal dragon rears back its head and releases a silent roar.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To create a skeleton requires effort and concentration, for the will of the creature must be battled and overcome when unlife fills the body.  Because of this, few sorcerors attempt to reanimate the bones of a dragon.  Those that try usually end up crushed immediately by the dragon's tail, or impaled on the razor-teeth of its maw.  It is said that the great spellbinders of a previous age kept skeletal dragons as a sign of their personal power, the names of these wizards found carved on runic tablets deep in caves: Pelle, Falamar, and Wealhwin.
REAPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=reaper
REAPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a reaper
REAPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The reaper's empty expression seems fixed on you.
REAPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Agents of death and the afterlife, reapers are sad creatures forced to cull the marked living for all eternity.  Black-cloaked and wraith-like, reapers carry massive, wicked scythes which they use to end the lives of the living and send their souls to the world below.
PLAYER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=player
PLAYER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the player
PLAYER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The player is like a sparrow flying through a feasting-hall: he or she gets glimpses of light and laughter, a few brief moments of happiness and warmth, before flying back into the darkness.  The great philosopher Hobbes wrote that the life of man was, "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"; applied to the player, this seems particularly apt.
PLAYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The player says, "I'm really not supposed to be an actual creature in-game!"
RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rat
RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rat
RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, long-tailed rodent with fur ranging from black to brown to grey, rats are ubiquitous in all parts of the world.  It is thought that they originated in the great central lands, and then made their way from island to island either by swimming or ship, depending on the distance.  A tiny, frail creature, the rat is nonetheless known to attack when hungry, capable of dealing some damage using its sharp teeth.
RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rat squeaks.
MOLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mole
MOLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mole
MOLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small subterranean mammals, moles are blinded by their habitat, unable to see at all.  However, their other senses are strong: moles can small very well, and have an incredible sense of hearing.  Moles are not large, rarely growing more than a foot in size, but they have sharp teeth and claws, and will defend themselves if provoked.
MOLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mole squeaks at you.
GHOST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghost
GHOST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghost
GHOST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Spirits of the once-living, ghosts are caught in a land of eternal twilight, never living, never dead.  It is said that they are forced by fate to roam the earth, shackled between worlds due to unsettled business.  They often appear near where they once lived, unnerving the living, frightening pets and livestock.  Ghosts tend to look much the same as their former selves, but transparent, and untroubled by walls and doors.
GHOST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghost's face becomes pure grief, pure sorrow.
FOX_MAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox mage
FOX_MAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox mage
FOX_MAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the legends of many low-land peoples, the fox plays the part of trickster.  Surely this is partially due to its appearance, long-snouted and quick, but a number of these legends share some eerily common threads.  In them, the fox is said to take the form of a human traveller, appearing as a hooded man sometime around twilight.  These are no myth.  The creatures are demons from the black plain, neither good nor evil, but beings that exist outside the bonds of moral philosophy.  Possessing of a clear, quick intelligence, they command oracular magics capable of debilitating those they find threatening.  It is said that those who cross them are found beside the roadside, their faces bitten and torn beyond all recognition.
FOX_MAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox mage peers at you from beneath its hood.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most great warriors pass, they are surrounded by family and friends, sent off to the afterlife by those they loved most in life.  But there are some who do not make it so far.  Every warrior carries with himself the ones he killed; those without anyone to help shoulder the burden in life become transformed in death, taking spectral form.  From within the armour, their eyes burn endlessly, still haunted, still trapped, unable to find peace.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=From beneath its visor, the spectral knight stares at you, its ghostly eyes a pair of burning coals.
QUILLICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quillich
QUILLICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quillich
QUILLICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A man-eating creature described by legend, the quillich is a fearsome creature that lives deep underground, emerging only briefly into the world above.  Its body is covered with rock-like protusions that resemble a porcupine's quills, hence its name.  With sharp teeth and claws, it burrows slowly, making its way through caverns and dungeons to feast on the unwary.
QUILLICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quillich shrieks.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wizards spend their lives in study, researching magics known and unknown.  During their studies and travels, some will commune with elemental and demonic creatures.  The most greedy, the most eager for fame will trade their soul for powerful magics, and that debt is always collected.  After the wizard dies, his spirit is shackled to the earth, bound by his word to walk until the world's end.  But though the body rots, the mind remains sharp, and spectral wizards will unleash torrential magics on those unfortunate enough to interrupt their travels.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral wizard murmurs something in an ancient tongue.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The unsettled spirits of ancient lords and ladies, spectral lords are powerful apparitions caught between the worlds.  Long after the body wastes away and becomes absorbed by the earth, spectral lords walk the heaths and fens, the reign of their houses long past.  They remain dressed in their death-clothes, and carry blades imbued with powerful magics, given to them in death to carry to the next life.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral lord says nothing, its mouth open in a voiceless scream.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There have been a number of recorded empires throughout history, and others lost to time.  At the head of each is an emperor, or less often, an empress.  Each are sent to the afterlife with a lavish array of gifts: gold and silver, beautiful weapons and armour, even their favoured guards, family, and pets.  But sometimes this is not enough, and the spirit persists.  Spectral emperors roam far beyond the life of their empires, watching the rise and fall of many peoples, watching the mountains grow and shrink, never happy, never able to slip the earth and ascend into the world beyond.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral emperor stares through you.
HELLBORE_BEETLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hellbore beetle
HELLBORE_BEETLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hellbore beetle
HELLBORE_BEETLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought to be no more than a myth, the hellbore beetle recently destroyed those notions in terrifying fashion, with two of the insects boring up from the earth to consume a number of villages before disappearing back into their massive hole.  The few that survived told of insects larger than a dragons, and faster, too.  Their jaws drip with a corrosive acid, and their backs are said to have a distinctive purple-red pattern, under which lie a pair of wings that allow flight for brief periods.  Since the attack, there have been no sightings of these terrifying creatures, though it is thought that they live deep underground in caverns or abandoned dungeons.
HELLBORE_BEETLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hellbore beetle rears up.
CORPSE_RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The corpse rat is a large subspecies of the common rat, typically growing to three times the size.  Instantly recognizable by its sickly grey fur, the corpse rat makes its burrow within the carcasses of fallen creatures, both sheltering and feeding within the carrion.  Corpse rats are known to be fearless, attacking creatures many times their size, regardless of the peril.
CORPSE_RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse rat squeaks.
GREEN_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=green slime
GREEN_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a green slime
GREEN_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature of some ancient magic, green slimes are largely inert, but will attack creatures that approach.  If successful, the slime will envelop the creature within itself, slowly dissolving its prey while slowing the natural rotting process.  Depending on the size of the creature, this may keep the slime fed for weeks, or even months.
IMP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=imp
IMP_DESCRIPTION_SID=an imp
IMP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Imps are small, magical creatures, barely two feet in height.  Vaguely human in appearance, they are nonetheless very ugly, with squat, twisted features.  Descended from some common ancestor as the fae, they share a common wilfulness and sense of mischief.  They are thought to live deep underground, in caverns accessible only through the trunks of rotted trees.  When provoked, they attack with slim, stone-bladed knives.
IMP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The imp chitters incomprehensively.
GOBLIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin
GOBLIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin
GOBLIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are short, cunning humanoids with sharp features and sharper teeth.  They live in small tribes on the outer islands, though recently they have been spotted closer and closer to the centre lands.   Despite their smaller size, they are ferocious creatures, afraid of nothing.  They wear ratty, tattered clothing, and are skilled with their sharp, curved blades.
GOBLIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin chuckles, "You would make a fine stew, I think!"
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin trapper
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin trapper
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Like the gnomes, goblins delight in complex mechanical devices.  But gnomes use this love for their own betterment, while goblins are beings of evil and chaos.  Many of them that wander world bring with them rocks, crossbow bolts, arrows - anything that they can rig up at a moment's notice.  These traps litter the dungeons, hung from ceilings, tucked into crevices, or buried beneath the floor.  Trappers themselves are quite distinctive, wearing wide-brimmed hats and layers of fox-furs as protection against the heat and cold of the upper world, and the ruins beneath it.
GOBLIN_TRAPPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin trapper cackles, "Don't bolt! I'm going to rock you!"
CHAOSLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chaosling
CHAOSLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chaosling
CHAOSLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the most minor denizens of the black plains, chaoslings are tiny little demons with a penchant for mischief.  Mercurial and temperamental, they glow with flame one second, holy fire the next.  They find their way out of the black plains and proceed to curdle milk, snatch housecats, burn cakes.  They enjoy watching the chaos that ensues, and dart back down as soon as they're discovered.
CHAOSLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chaosling cackles with glee.
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins often form raiding parties, sailing out on small boats to loot settlements and slake their thirst for blood.  Owing to their small size, a number never return.  But over time, the veterans of these campaigns grow stronger, and more cunning.  Clad in the best armour, wielding the finest swords, these champions become the leaders of their comrades and are known to be formidable foes.
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin champion cackles mercilessly.
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin elite guard
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin elite guard
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblin chieftains get where they are not by birth or election, but by cold steel.  And as a result, they make many enemies along the way.  As protection, they retain guardsmen, the most dangerous of which are the elite guard.  Taken from the greatest of the raiders and champions, the elite guard are imposing figures.  They dress in full chain armour, typically wielding a polearm such as a halberd or spear, and wear as a helm the skull of a lion, boar, or bear.
GOBLIN_ELITE_GUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin elite guard yells,  "Halt!"
GOBLIN_IMPALER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin impaler
GOBLIN_IMPALER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin impaler
GOBLIN_IMPALER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are a cruel race, it is said, enjoying the cries of lesser and weaker creatures.  The most cruel are impalers, and serve as the shock troops of the raiding parties.  They carry savage, barbed spears, meant to cause massive bleeding and strike fear.  After combat, they skin their foes, wearing the bloody, irregular skins as capes.  The heads they wear as necklaces or pauldrons, the flesh slowly rotting until the skull is bare.  The civilized peoples of the world fear and loathe goblin impalers, and those that are captured are given summary deaths, the bodies left for crows.
GOBLIN_IMPALER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin impaler grins, wide-mouthed, like the skulls it wears.
CAHRI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cahri
CAHRI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cahri
CAHRI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young snakeling woman, Cahri left the Snake Lands to pursue her way in the world.  After a short spell as a soldier, and then sell-sword, she turned her attention to the plunder of the ancient underground caverns and complexes that litter the landscape.  A dungeoneer by trade, she wears tight-fitting, flexible clothing covered by bits of scavenged armour.  At her waist sits a pair of battered falchions.  Her name is spoken in whispers among adventurers - a worthy companion in the depths when things get dangerous, it is said, but not to be trusted, not for one second.
CAHRI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cahri eyes you up, her eyes fierce and cold.
MINOTAUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=minotaur
MINOTAUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a minotaur
MINOTAUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Minotaurs are the combination of bull and man.  Standing near seven feet tall, minotaurs have the bodies of huge, powerful men, with the head of a great bull.  They attack with their huge skulls, smashing and goring their foes.  They live deep underground in the darkest caverns.  At night, they stomp and roar, the sounds echoing up through the rock to the world above.
MINOTAUR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The minotaur bellows in rage.
HYDRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hydra
HYDRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hydra
HYDRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A many-headed serpent steeped in myth, hydras typically live in swamps and wetlands.  They are also known to live in any caves and caverns with a sufficient amount of water to sustain them.  Hydras are venemous, and due to their many heads, capable of injecting huge amounts of a powerful toxin into their victims.
HYDRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hydras many heads hiss in rage.
NIGHTMARE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nightmare
NIGHTMARE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nightmare
NIGHTMARE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A coal-coloured mare from the black plains, the nightmare appears as from a terrifying dream.  Its eyes are bright red, and burn like small embers.  Wisps of smoke trail from its nostrils as it snorts, and from its mouth, it breathes short bursts of flame.  Many people believe that nightmares are forerunners, and that those who see them will die soon after.
NIGHTMARE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nightmare shrieks.
RED_OOZE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=red ooze
RED_OOZE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a red ooze
RED_OOZE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Red oozes are unsentient magical oozes that thrive in moisture-rich environments.  They attempt to engulf nearby objects, whereby a magical process converts the matter into intense heat.  Easily identifiable by their bright red glow, red oozes bubble about, moving imperceptibly slowly, but striking quickly.
SELLSWORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sellsword
SELLSWORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sellsword
SELLSWORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The sellsword is a skilled swordsman with few loyalties.  His services are available to the highest bidder, and can change as quickly as new bid is received.  Sellswords are not rich men, making enough to scrape by.  They tend to wear scraps of leather and mail: enough to protect some key areas, but not enough to hinder their movement.  But if their armour is suspect, their weapon is not.  Their swords are always well-made and well-tended, sharpened daily, and always ready for use.
SELLSWORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sellsword says, "It's nothing personal, adventurer, but I will kill you."
GRIFFIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=griffin
GRIFFIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a griffin
GRIFFIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The griffin is a majestic creature found high in the mountains, guarding treasure hoards teeming with artifacts and gold.

GRIFFIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The griffin screeches.
RAM_DEMON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ram demon
RAM_DEMON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ram demon
RAM_DEMON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A terrifying demon born from ram and man, ram demons are lesser creatures of the black plains.  They have a ram's hooves, the body and arms of a man, with a ram's head, the horns curling sharply and dripping with gore.  Their shaggy hair is caked with blood, and their mouths open to several rows of pointed, rotting teeth.
RAM_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ram demon stomps and snorts.
ANGEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=angel
ANGEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an angel
ANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Heavenly creatures, the divine creation of the Nine, angels live in the heavens, where they watch over the people of the world.  In their physical form, they appear to be beautiful men and women, white-robed and winged, glowing with a white or gold aura.  Angels are sometimes sent to punish the wicked, and strike with holy blades of unfathomable power.
ANGEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The angel chants, "Holy, holy, holy."
UNICORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=unicorn
UNICORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a unicorn
UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A fabled animal of purity, the unicorn is a white mare with a spiral horn in the centre of its head.  It lives in the deep woodlands and fields, far from civilization.  While not unfriendly, the unicorn is untrusting and fearful, liable to lash out when approached.  Unicorn horns have long been thought to have magical healing properties, able to cure sickness, poison, and the most grievous wounds.
UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The unicorn whinnies.
BLACK_UNICORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The counter-balance to the unicorn, the black unicorn is a creature of shadow and darkness.  Lacking the horn of its white counterpart, the black unicorn instead has a non-functional pair of wings.  It is for this reason that it is sometimes known as a "black pegasus".  Black unicorns are greatly feared for their aggressiveness, attacking with pure chaos and entropy, dissipating into shadow when finally slain.
BLACK_UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black unicorn whinnies.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are inherently war-like, and many become raiders, creating war-parties that sail to distant shores to pillage settlements and pilfer gold.  Goblin raiders are the members of these crews.  They carry long spears, and wear bits of armour taken from the dead.  As well, they have a gruesome custom of removing the heads and arms of their victims.  The raiders line the masts of their ships with the skulls, and tie the arm-bones near the heads of their spears, creating an ugly clacking sound.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin raider laughs, "Your head would look good on my pike!"
GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golem
GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a golem
GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Golems are powerful, mindless creations fused by the combination of magic, divinity, and clay.  In folklore, powerful sages created man-like forms from mud and clay, providing the spark of life from arcane knowledge and faithful prayer.  Golems are effective protectors of their creators.  Able to fight without fear and pain, they bring to bear great physical force, fighting until their life force is finally extinguished.
MAMMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mammoth
MAMMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mammoth
MAMMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mammoth is an enormous, elephantine mammal with shaggy fur that ranges from tan to black.  They are heard even before they are seen, for their stamping shakes the earth, and their trunks bellow and blare louder than a trumpet.  Though they are far from extinct, their numbers are less than in the past, for the ivory from their tusks is considered the greatest and purest, and is widely sought.
MAMMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A mammoth bellows.
SKELETON_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When the bodies of mere mortals are fused with dark magics, they produce skeletons; when the body of a great warrior or king is treated the same, the result is the horrifying skeleton king.  Resembling a normal skeleton but garbed in robes or armour, skeleton kings' status in life becomes its power in death.  They are frighteningly quick.  Rather than shamble, they run at a full sprint, sword drawn, ready to make short work of all that stand in their way.
SKELETON_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton king laughs silently, and its jaws click and clatter.
DEMON_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demon lord
DEMON_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demon lord
DEMON_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Demon lords are the lesser rulers of the black plains, granted dominion over a small parcel of land and its inhabitants.  They are intelligent, organized, well-studied, and incredibly strong.  They superficially resemble men and women, though much bulkier.  Their skin ranges from red to black, their eyes burn like embers, and their voices are a deep and rumbling growl.  Demon lords wear fine raiment and carry swords that burn with an unearthly light.  
DEMON_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demon lord cackles, and his blade glows with magical fire.
ARCHANGEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=archangel
ARCHANGEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an archangel
ARCHANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The highest of the celestial beings, archangels are the devout servants of the Nine, ready to help their servants and smite their foes.  They have a vaguely human appearance, though their blazing, golden aura makes it impossible to ascertain.  Their voices are pure music, sounding like flutes, horns, and trumpets, used to sing praise to the ones they serve.
ARCHANGEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The archangel exclaims, "Glory be to the Nine!"
COSMIC_INFERNO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cosmic inferno
COSMIC_INFERNO_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cosmic inferno
COSMIC_INFERNO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Some sort of extra-terrestrial race hailing from the core of planets, cosmic infernos appear as massive, black flames.  Intensely destructive, they do not distinguish friend from foe, burning through everything before them.  They appear only briefly, creating a wide swath of destruction before vanishing again.
COSMIC_INFERNO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cosmic inferno spits and crackles.
TROGLODYTE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=troglodyte
TROGLODYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troglodyte
TROGLODYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Distant cousins of man, troglodytes are short humanoids who dwell deep in caves and mountains, almost as deep as dwarves.  They stand just over five feet in height, and are much more dense and powerful than humans.  Their features are more compact, too, with close-set eyes, blocky noses, and hunched frames.  They wear tanned hides and furs, and favour simple, heavy clubs.
TROGLODYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A troglodyte spits a few words of a low, guttural tongue.
TROLL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=troll
TROLL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troll
TROLL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Trolls live at the fringes of civilization: in caves and caverns, deep in swamps, under bridges.  They are the enormous and dim-witted kin of ogres, very distantly related.  Warty, filthy, and stupid, they make up for their shortcomings with immense strength.  They rip apart their prey with their bare hands, feasting on flesh and marrow, leaving the broken bones scattered around their lairs like so much debris.
TROLL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The troll rears its head back and roars.
BEHOLDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=beholder
BEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a beholder
BEHOLDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Rising from the depths of the black plains, beholders levitate by magical force, hovering several feet above the ground.  Beholders resemble a giant eye atop a cackling mouth, surrounded by a mass of writhing tentacles.  Electrically charged, the eye of the beholder is known to paralyze its prey, holding it in place while the teeth and tentacles devour it alive.
BEHOLDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The beholder laughs, baring its lips back over rows of sharpened teeth.
DYING_STAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dying star
DYING_STAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dying star
DYING_STAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of some distant world, dying stars are globes of intensely burning gas.  They are well-known because their colours often change quickly: from red, to yellow, to white, cyan, and blue.  As they get hotter, they become increasingly dangerous, moving faster and burning with a terrifying intensity.  It's said that there is hope, though - for they cannot sustain bursts of great heat for long, and eventually restart the process, becoming a weak, slow-burning red light.
DYING_STAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Song-like voice appears in your head, its meaning unknowable.
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire elemental
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire elemental
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Servants of the Nine, fire elementals rampage and destroy those who have angered the divine.  The few survivors have whispered of spiralling columns of flame, twisting and turning, a horrific cyclone of heat and destruction.  And as quickly as they appear, they are gone, disappearing in an instant with the completion of their work.  It is thought that fire elementals are favoured by Aurelion and Voros, but with no way to ascertain this, it remains scholarly speculation.
FIRE_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire elemental blazes with unbearable heat.
TENTACLED_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tentacled horror
TENTACLED_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tentacled horror
TENTACLED_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Each of the Nine has their creations: Vedere made men, elves, and dwarves; Voros created the serpents and wyrms; Celeste created the seraphs and angels.  Sceadugenga extends his grasp through the writhing mass of tentacled horrors.  Tendrils of inky blackness that dim the very light around them, tentacled horrors arrive through tears in the fabric of the universe, rampaging through the realms of the living before disappearing once more.
DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dragon
DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dragon
DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mightiest of beasts, the dragon is a massive serpent capable of walking on four legs, or flying high into the heavens on its wings.  Dragons are wicked as they are strong, and greedy.  They love gold and gems, which they hoard within their lairs, high atop mountains or deep beneath the earth.  Their scales shimmer and are known to come in a range of colours, from dull greens to dark reds, silver, black, and blue.  All dragons are fire-breathers.  Their breath is death to the unwary, hot enough to melt steel and shatter bone.
DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dragon unleashes a roar that shakes the earth.
SYLPH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sylph
SYLPH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sylph
SYLPH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tiny air spirits, sylphs dance on the winds and currents of air, so quick as to be barely visible.  They resemble tiny, beautiful women, merry and capricious.  On their backs are delicate wings, which seem almost still as they move.  They charge the air as they dance and dive; if many sylphs gather together, then the result is surely storms.
SYLPH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sylph laughs, and her laughter carries on the sudden wind.
GITHRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=githra
GITHRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a githra
GITHRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Said to be the living embodiment of tiny, dead stars, the githra appear as perfect spheres of incomprehensible blackness, surrounded by a blazing ring of light.  They move quickly, zipping from place to place.  They dim their surroundings, bending the light towards them, and those that have angered them have found themselves surrounded by tendrils of living darkness.
GITHRA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The githra rumbles ominously.
NAIAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=naiad
NAIAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a naiad
NAIAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When Vedere made the lakes and rivers, he made the naiads to watch over them.  Naiads are water spirits, moving through currents and under still waters.  When they appear before men, they take the form of impossibly beautiful women, long-haired and naked.  They speak some sort of ethereal language, their words sung sweet as music.  A naiad's beauty has charmed many to follow them into the water.  Many have drowned.  Those that survive talk of a delerium, sinking below the waves in a naiad's embrace, before breaking free of the spell, and surfacing.
NAIAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The naiad asks, "Won't you come join me in the river?"
DRYAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dryad
DRYAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dryad
DRYAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ancient tree-spirits, dryads inhabit the trees of the old-growth forests rarely walked by elf or man.  They can briefly take physical form, appearing as a beautiful man or woman; this is done, it is said, to lure travellers away from the dryad's tree.  For the dryad's life is tied to one particular tree, and should that tree be felled, the dryad will die with it.
DRYAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dryad looks at you shyly.
HARPY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=harpy
HARPY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a harpy
HARPY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange cross between woman and bird, the harpy lives far from civilization, terrorizing those misfortunate enough to cross her path.  Harpies have the torso and head of a woman.  Rather than arms, they possess huge wings, and a bird's taloned feet.  They possess little beauty, their faces having sharp features: grim mouths, sharp noses, narrow eyes.  They are unfriendly and ill-tempered, and think little of swooping in to attack unwary adventurers.
HARPY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The harpy shrieks.
CORPSE_FIEND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse fiend
CORPSE_FIEND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse fiend
CORPSE_FIEND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Appearing every bit the undead, corpse fiends are something different indeed.  Stitched together from many forms, human and animal and monstrous, they are animated not by the unholy magics of undeath, but rather strange and ancient sorceries.  With bits of body and skin, their forms meld with tails and wings and paws.  They are automatons, mindless, and magical.  They attack furiously and without regard for good or evil, bent to the will of a wizard who has bound them with a singular and unknowable purpose.
CORPSE_FIEND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse fiend opens its mouth, revealing a writhing mass of worms.
OREAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=oread
OREAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=an oread
OREAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Naiads watch the lakes and rivers, dryads the ancient lowland forests; the great mountains are watched by the oreads, who are part of the mountain spruce and pines.  Tall, beautiful creatures, the oreads stand taller than the other nymphs and are regarded as the most dangerous.  Tall and lithe, they move very quickly.  Their open hands strike with the blunt force of heavy stones, and when threatened, it is said they give no quarter.
OREAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The oread regards you cooly.
CLERIC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cleric
CLERIC_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cleric
CLERIC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The clergy of the nine act in a number of different roles.  Some function as administrators, working in the central lands to administer the functioning of their churches and temples.  Others serve in the ministry, bringing the Word of the edges of the world.  Some live in large, opulent houses; some in bearskin tents among the nomadic tribes.  But all of them have a role to play in keeping the Nine's sacred flame burning against the darkness of the world.
CLERIC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cleric nods a greeting at you.
VAMPIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=vampire
VAMPIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a vampire
VAMPIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Masters of the night, vampires are undead lords who feast on the blood of the living.  Having made pacts with dark powers, vampires use their blood magic to hover silently, transform into creatures such as bats and rats, and charm the living with illusion and glamour.  They must feed regularly, requiring the blood of the living or else withering slowly, aging into the brittle, dry husk of an ancient corpse. 
VAMPIRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The vampire smiles, revealing a dark and bloody grin.
COLOSSUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=colossus
COLOSSUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a colossus
COLOSSUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Statues imbued with magical life-force, colossi can stand more than a hundred feet high.  They are painstakingly carved by master sculptors from a single block of marble or stone, before a sorceror performs the rites to animate the creation.  Typically serving as guardians, they stand watch over tombs and palaces, unmoving until an intruder is detected.  Then they rise, wordlessly, shaking the earth around them as they rush to attack.
QUADARI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quadari
QUADARI_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quadari
QUADARI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black spirits of the underworld, said to be the souls of wizards and priests, the quadari from the underworld and glide on the black nights.  They come for children, for the unwary, looking to bring new souls to the underworld far before their time.  Their touch is deathly cold.  When their victims are frozen, the quadari envelop them, and then fly back from whence they came, ripping the life from their prey and guiding the soul to the world beyond.
QUADARI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quadari glides through the air, its sound akin to a low wail.
WYVERN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyvern
WYVERN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyvern
WYVERN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Huge reptiles with features of both wyrms and dragons, wyverns are massive creatures that figure prominently in legend and myth.  They can stand on their two hind legs, but lack the two front legs of dragons; and, like dragons, they can take to the sky on their massive wings.  Wyverns lack the intelligence of their reptilian cousins, however, owning only the low intelligence of lizards and snakes.  They do not want for ferocity, and use their massive teeth and talons to tear apart the unwary.
WYVERN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyvern screeches.
SKRAELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skraeling
SKRAELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skraeling
SKRAELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skraelings are a tribe of men who live far to the north and south.  Dressed in the hides of seal, walrus, and bear, they hunt from hide covered boats with ivory-tipped spears and harpoons.  Working in groups, they hunt the massive black whales that prowl the northern sea-lanes, dividing the meat and blubber between their families.  In appearance, they tend to be slightly shorter than most men, with jet-black hair and dark skin, and speak a language understood only by them.
SKRAELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skraeling speaks to you in some indecipherable tongue.
MARVELLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Marvelle
MARVELLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Marvelle
MARVELLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A witchling cast out by her people for her innate, terrifying magics, Marvelle is a young woman forced to fend for herself.  A long scar down her right cheek speaks to her hermitic lifestyle.  She wears a simple cotton tunic, and wears a battered backpack.  Her walking stick is twisted and knotty.  Capped with a dragon in flight, it appears to glow with a strange, blue-grey light.  Her speech is soft and slow.  Almost inaudible, her voice seems rough from years of disuse.  She chooses her words hesitantly, unused to the speech of everyday people, awkward and fumbling except when calling her magics, which she unleashes with quick and practiced ferocity.
MARVELLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Marvelle watches you with curiosity.
AIR_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=air elemental
AIR_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an air elemental
AIR_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The most powerful of the elementals, air elementals are storms compressed into being.  They form in moments, wreak destruction, and dissipate in an instant.  It is said that air elementals are preceeded by a horrible whispering sound, one that builds in intensity until it becomes unbearably loud.  Formed by the Nine to punish the wicked, air elementals are thought to be favoured by the Lady and the Trickster.
AIR_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The air elemental spins about you, a dangerous and deafening roar.
TITAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=titan
TITAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a titan
TITAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Divine creatures, nearly equal in stature to the Nine, the Titans are an eternal race created by Vedere to protect the heavens and earth.  Towering near a thousand feet high, they descend from the heavens to mete out swift justice, ready to strike down the wicked and insolent with hammers that strike like thunder and shake the earth.
TITAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The titan thunders, "Begone, mortal!"
BLACK_CREEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black creeper
BLACK_CREEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black creeper
BLACK_CREEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A primeval species of spider, black creepers are among the most feared of the insects.  They are marked by a distinctive, blue-black zig-zag pattern across their back.  Feeding on foxes, deer, and sometimes people, they inject a powerful poison that eats their victim from the inside.  Their nests are often underground burrows, marked by the undigestible possessions of their victims.
FLOATING_EYE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=floating eye
FLOATING_EYE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a floating eye
FLOATING_EYE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The bane of many an adventurer, the floating eye is a strange, magical creature found throughout the world.  Approximately the size of a large stone, they hover at eye-level above the ground, staring, unblinking.  They are able to stun their opponents with a small jolt of electricity.  This can cause paralysis, and has caused the slow death of many unwary explorers.
BARROW_SPIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=barrow spider
BARROW_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a barrow spider
BARROW_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Green-black arachnids that nest near the barrows of the newly dead, barrow spiders are smaller than an ivory piece but possess a concentrated venom capable of killing creatures many times their size.  Along with this fearsome reputation, they are also known for spinning beautiful and elaborate webs, considered by some to be a tribute to the nearby dead.
GREAT_SERPENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=great serpent
GREAT_SERPENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a great serpent
GREAT_SERPENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Great serpents are an ancient species of snake, older than recorded time.  The few that survive live far underground, or in ancient forests, or deep in marshlands.  Their scales are dull green in appearance, and their great fangs can bite bone and pierce steel.  The ancient Tome of Zork remarks that a huge fierce green snake once barred the way of the anonymous hero in the subterranean caverns.
GREAT_SERPENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The great serpent hisses.
DEEP_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=deep wizard
DEEP_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a deep wizard
DEEP_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Beneath the gnomes and dwarves there live dark things.  Among the most cunning and fiendish are the deep wizards, a race of creatures that cloak themselves in dwarfskin, and commune with ancient spirits.  They study texts as old as the race of faerie, mastering the dark magics of their forebearers.  Deep wizards have an almost insubstantial appearance.  Their flesh is inky black, and appears hazy in the low light.  Their eyes are the most startling, glowing bright, ranging from red to gold to green.  The voices of deep wizards are little more than a low whisper, murmuring incantations to unleash hell upon the world.
DEEP_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The deep wizard whispers, "Come with me, to dusk and darkness..."
ASTRAL_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=astral horror
ASTRAL_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an astral horror
ASTRAL_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Black, spirit-like creatures from higher planes of existence, astral horrors shift between the astral and the physical.  They hover in the air, and superficially resemble featureless people.  Their skin is jet-black, as soft as velvet, and cold as death.  One of the most striking features is their lack of hands.  Their arms taper into jagged, black spikes, which they thrust with incredible force to quickly slay the living.
ASTRAL_HORROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient speech of the astral horror echoes soundlessly in your head.
SHADOW_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow wolf
SHADOW_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow wolf
SHADOW_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wolves corrupted by dark magic, shadow wolves are much larger than the common wolf, with shiny, blue-black fur.  Their teeth and tongue are stained a deep black.  They exhale tendrils of blackness as they breathe, and their bite leaves a foul corruption, capable of lingering and becoming petrification.
SHADOW_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow wolf howls.
CALLARA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Callara
CALLARA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Callara
CALLARA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Having displayed an unusual aptitude for magic at a young age, Callara was sent by her family to study wizardry in the central lands.  But the masters discovered a young girl with a hard edge and a chilling personality, a child who made blood offerings of small animals to Shiver.  And so they sent her back in shame.  Growing up an outcast, her resentment roiled and thickened.  One day, without a word, she left the community, taking only a curved knife and the clothes on her back.  Wandering the countryside, she brings her black magic to bear on the weak and helpless, retreating back into the wild at the first sign of danger.
CALLARA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Callara's eyes glint with a deep, mid-winter cold.
SHADOW_SNAKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow snake
SHADOW_SNAKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow snake
SHADOW_SNAKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive constrictors that have been tainted by foul magics, shadow snakes are a deep blue-black in colour.  They prefer dark places, where they are nearly invisible, save for their eyes, which are pure milky white in colour.  Shadow snakes coil about their victim, and inject a terrifying poison with their fangs.  It rots the skin, leeching the colour, and causes a hardening that resembles rock.  It is for this reason that shadow snakes are known in some areas as "stone snakes", and hunted ruthlessly.
SHADOW_SNAKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow snake hisses.
SHADOW_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow beast
SHADOW_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow beast
SHADOW_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shadow beasts are the corruption of huge creatures such as rhinoceroses, bears, or lions.  Their hide takes on a deep blue in appearance, almost black, and they attack with unparallelled ferocity.  Their claws and tusks are coated with some foul toxin that causes petrification.  Few wild shadow beasts are known.  They are hunted as they are found; less for trophies as for the safety felt when they are gone.
SHADOW_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow beast bellows in fury.
SHADOW_DEMON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow demon
SHADOW_DEMON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow demon
SHADOW_DEMON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A black demon from the depths of the plains, shadow demons resemble an upright bull with human arms and legs, and have a set of leathery wings.  They have a set of immense, curling horns off the sides of their heads.  With these, they gore and disembowel the living.  They are sent to eviscerate the mortal form to make way for the spirit to follow to the lands of the dead.
SHADOW_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow demon roars with hate.
SHADOW_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wyrms live deep beneath the earth, where they make their lairs in ancient cracks and crevices.  But sometimes, they delve too far, snaking through passageways to a place where ancient magic still sleeps.  Those that do become infused with the magical taint, and grow frighteningly powerful.  Their scales darken; their breath becomes wisps of chaos and darkness.  The wyrms sit on their great hoards, repeating ancient incantations and carving forgotten runes into the chambers and corridors.  In the eternal night of the under-lands, even their minds darken, corrupted more and more until eventually, the wyrm becomes little more than an automaton, controlled by the ancient magic it once discovered.
SHADOW_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow wyrm hisses, "Who are you, who disturbs my slumber?"
SNAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling
SNAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling
SNAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.  The resultant creatures horrified the world: standing nearly as tall as a man, the creatures had the scales and head of an enormous snake, with the remaining features human in appearance.  Cast to the fringes of the world, the snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.
SNAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling spits, "If you will not leave me alone, I will ensure that you do!"
SNAKELING_THUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling thug
SNAKELING_THUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling thug
SNAKELING_THUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakelings have a tough lot in life.  Hideous to the other races, seen as untrustworthy at best, they find true opportunities scarce and fleeting.  Because of this, many turn to simple banditry to survive.  Typically armed with clubs or knives, they prey on passers-by, relieving them of their money and finer possessions.  Snakeling thugs are distrusted even by other bandits; because of this, they tend to work alone, or in small groups of their own kind.
SNAKELING_THUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling thug spits and hisses.
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling sharpshooter
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling sharpshooter
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakelings tend to prefer barbed javelins, but some, when they leave their villages and the surrounding marshes, find the small javelins unwieldy.  Taking jobs with caravans, or as bodyguards, they have found that crossbows, combined with the startling and foreign appearance of the snakeling, provide a suitable combination of accuracy and intimidation.
SNAKELING_SHARPSHOOTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling sharpshooter glowers at you.
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling muckraker
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling muckraker
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While some snakelings make their way by thieving or other means, muckrakers take a slyer approach, relying on blackmail and extortion.  Their trade is information, and controlling its flow.  They listen at windows, on rooftops, in alleys; they threaten to expose adultery, treachery, shady business dealings.  For they understand that everyone has their secrets, and to ensure that the secrets are not well-known, they understand as well that everybody has their price.
SNAKELING_MUCKRAKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling muckraker breaks out into an unsettling smile.
SNAKELING_THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling thief
SNAKELING_THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling thief
SNAKELING_THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Marginalized by the rest of the world, snakelings do whatever it takes to survive: begging, odd jobs, mercenary work.  Many turn to thievery, and indeed they seem to have a natural aptitude for it.  Moving quickly and silently, they enrich themselves through the ivory of others.  Their ruthlessness is fearsome.  Where some would simply filch some coins, it is not uncommon for snakeling thieves to murder their victims to take their rings, bracelets, and even gold teeth.
SNAKELING_THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling thief smiles suddenly, and tenses.
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling assassin
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling assassin
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the other races, the strongest and deadliest typically become warriors or knights, and learn to face their opponents head-on.  But snakelings favour other qualities, and their most dangerous become assassins.  Cloaked in grey or black, snakeling assassins wear daggers and knives all over their bodies.  They move extremely quickly and with deadly grace, stalking their prey unseen until the very moment where they emerge from the shadows, blades in hand.
SNAKELING_ASSASSIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling assassin regards you coldly, its face expressionless save for the flickering of its tongue.
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling mercenary
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling mercenary
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Snakeling mercenaries are known and respected for their no-nonsense approach, and their cold-blooded pursuit of their goals.  They are, however, incredibly mercurial: as their goals change, they act accordingly, and quickly remove those that get in their way.  Snakeling mercenaries typically wear a bit of armour, but not much.  They wish to be able to move and strike quickly, preferring daggers and short swords to the larger weapons favoured by most others.
SNAKELING_MERCENARY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling mercenary regards you cooly.
SNAKELING_MAGUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling magus
SNAKELING_MAGUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling magus
SNAKELING_MAGUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Walking the line between wizard and witchling, the snakeling magi wield fearful blood magics.  In exchange for live sacrifices to their dark deities, they are granted tremendous magical powers.  They can call forth massive magical energies, see glimpses of the future, and scry into the past.  Snakeling magi are untrusted and hated by other races, and deeply feared by their own.
SNAKELING_MAGUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling magus' tongue flickers.
SNAKELING_CONJURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=snakeling conjurer
SNAKELING_CONJURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling conjurer
SNAKELING_CONJURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The strongest snakelings become assassins; the most clever become conjurers.  As a race, snakelings have a natural aptitude for magic, much more so than goblins or ogres.  Their magical preferences tend towards conjurations both real and imagined.  Skilled at both summonings and illusions, snakeling conjurers tap into what some scholars feel is the natural deception and duplicity of their race.  The skilled conjurer calls forth beings both real and imagined, hiding behind beasts and devils from history and myth.
SNAKELING_CONJURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The snakeling conjurer smiles thinly, and says something in a strange, ancient language.
KRAAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kraal
KRAAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kraal
KRAAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The older and stronger of two mercenary brothers, Kraal is an ox of a man.  Standing over seven feet tall, with arms larger than the legs of most men, he has a stupid and dangerous look on his face.  His clothing is in disrepair, needing patches or just replacement, and he wears a tattered suit of chain mail that has seen better days.  But strapped to his back is a massive cleaver of a blade.  An axe with a deep and long blade, it looks almost impossible to wield effectively.  Kraal says very little, speaking more in grunts or motions than actual language, but seems to understand - and enjoy - killing, very well indeed.
KRAAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kraal bellows, his expression that of a wild beast.
MURK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Murk
MURK_DESCRIPTION_SID=Murk
MURK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The younger of two mercenary brothers, Murk contracted a wasting disease during his childhood that caused his left arm to wither and shrivel, hanging useless by his side.  Far smaller than his elder brother, by more than a foot and a half, Murk makes up for his stature in cunning and speed.  His face is a mess of scars.  He wields a small stiletto which ordinarily remains concealed within the folds of his cloak, but which he can draw into his hand within an instant.
MURK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Murk appears to watch you from beneath his cowl.
ALTUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Altus
ALTUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Altus
ALTUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a man, Altus' name and dress place him from the central lands.  His stature seems out of proportion with his looks: though tall and muscular, he still looks every bit a boy.  He wears light blue clothing underneath segmented leather armour, and grips a short stabbing sword in his right hand.  A pair of javelins hang from his back.  His skin is ashen.  His eyes, too, look to be fading.  The culprit appears to be a wound on his arm, just below his pauldrons.  Some sort of scratch or cut, it is encircled by a throbbing, red ring, and oozes a thick, pus-like liquid.
ALTUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Altus grimaces at you, his body clenching with pain.
ZAEDA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Zaeda
ZAEDA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Zaeda
ZAEDA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creator of the Snakelings, venerated by his people as an unliving god, Zaeda paid a terrible price for his dark magic.  Granted near-eternal life by Shiver, he had the Snakelings built him a massive tower at the edge of the world.  Without need of food or drink, he shut himself into the top of the tower, and studied.  With his ever-increasing power, he wrapped the land in a shroud of illusion, bending light around it and making it invisible.  And, all the while, he studied his tomes.  Communing with Shiver, learning ancient rituals, he aged incredibly slowly, but age he did.  His skin began to rot; but, granted endless life, it remained in place, hanging wretchedly on his bones while teeming with worms.  His hair fell out save for a few strands.  And all the while, he studied, looking down on the world from his invisible fortress, plotting the day when he and his creations would march on the world.
ZAEDA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Zaeda catches you with a baleful gaze, his face crawling with worms.
ABOMINATION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=abomination
ABOMINATION_DESCRIPTION_SID=an abomination
ABOMINATION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A hideous demon from the depths of the black plains, the abomination figures in folk-lore and campfire stories, the punishment for wizards who would summon the untamable.  They are unthinking and unfeeling.  Animal-like, they have the body of a bull and four monstrous heads: these vary depending on the creature, and may include goat, man, bear, dragon, or any other creature.  Each of these heads breathes flames, monstrous green-white hellfire that incinerates anything in its path.  It is said that the demon princes keep abominations as pets, and value them deeply, for these monsters are very loyal, very stupid, and very deadly.
ABOMINATION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The abomination's four heads shriek and wail.
FORERUNNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=forerunner
FORERUNNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a forerunner
FORERUNNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The ghost stories of the coastal folk tell of sudden visions, popularly known as forerunners, that foretell some sort of death or tragedy.  The spirits that complete these prophecies are called forerunners as well.  Hazy in appearance, taking no fixed shape, they move quickly, faster than their victims, and kill them with an intense and otherwordly cold.  They come only for certain victims - indeed, the only reason their existence is known is because of the survival of some companions whose demise was not foretold.  It is said that armour is no help against these spirits, and that their icy touch can pierce through even the thickest steel.
FORERUNNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=In the forerunner's murky haze, you see a vision of your coming death.
PLANEWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=planewalker
PLANEWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a planewalker
PLANEWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures not of this earth, planewalkers dwell in a different place entirely, occasionally appearing, as if by chance, in the living world.  They appear to be figures of blazing light.  Their forms shift and shimmer, appearing humanoid one minute, draconic the next.  Little is known about planewalkers save for the intense danger they present.  Attacking with ferocious lightning storms, they are aggressive and volatile, seemingly interested in nothing less than the destruction of all around them.
PLANEWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The planewalker's voice echoes in your mind, its words long, languid, and indecipherable.
STONE_WORM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone worm
STONE_WORM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone worm
STONE_WORM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Stone worms burrow deep within the earth, moving slowly and feeding on innumerable insects.  They live for an incredibly long time, and as the years progress, the tiny worms become smaller and smaller, with the largest growing twenty to thirty metres long.  They will feed on anything living, digesting bone, flesh, and steel with a powerful acid.  The worms have a reddish-pink tinge.  Stone worms get their name from the strength of their epidermis, which is flexible, thick, and difficult to penetrate.
STONE_WORM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The stone worm rears and circles, acid dripping from its maw.
REDCAP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=redcap
REDCAP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a redcap
REDCAP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Redcaps are little creatures that live in castles and other out-of-the-way places.  Seen by some as demons, others believe them to remnants of the fair folk that once walked the earth.  Redcaps appear as tiny, wizened old men, gaunt, with enormous eyes.  Their clothes are barely better than rags, and they carry little stone blades in their hands.  Their teeth are long and sharp.  Owing to this, their mouths are a mess of blood and gore, and the trail of a redcap is easily found.
REDCAP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The redcap scowls, "Why are you here?  Tell me, or I'll cut it out of you!"
DRAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=drakeling
DRAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a drakeling
DRAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Known as "fairy wyrms" to some, drakelings represent a distinct evolutionary path from either dragons or wyrms.  Like wyrms, they are serpentine, lacking the legs of a dragon.  But like dragons, they possess functional wings.  Unlike either, they are unable to breathe flame, but emit puffs of acid, instead.  Fairy dragons are about as long as a man is tall, and very nimble.  They dart about on the air, incessantly curious, and quick to anger.
DRAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The drakeling warbles and hisses.
ARACHNOS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=arachnos
ARACHNOS_DESCRIPTION_SID=an arachnos
ARACHNOS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A nightmarish demon, the arachnos combines the body of a monstrous spider with the head of an old man or woman.  The name comes from the translation of the ancient Tablet of Names, which inscribed the name in runic script beneath a six-inch carving.  Arachnos lack teeth.  Instead, they spit a powerful acid, which they use to dissolve their victims before feeding on the liquid remains.
ARACHNOS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The arachnos cackles.
BEHEMOTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=behemoth
BEHEMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a behemoth
BEHEMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=King of the beasts, the behemoth is a monstrous creature even larger than a dragon.  It stands on four legs, and its body is covered with a rough, scaly hide.  A number of horns protrude from its head, and on its feet, it has talons sharp as any raptor.  Behemoths gore and tear and pummel, their fearsome strength lauded in ancient poetry, where anonymous heroes attempt, always unsuccessfully, to slay the beasts.
BEHEMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The behemoth roars!
FLARE_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=flare beast
FLARE_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a flare beast
FLARE_BEAST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=At the centre of the earth live magical beings crafted of pure flame.  Flare beasts are the dread servants of Voros, creatures of ember and flame, whose appearance shifts so as to appear like a dragon one moment, a titan the next.  They move with ferocious speed.  Their touch is intensely hot, igniting whatever it comes in contact with.  And when they open their enormous jaws, they release a torrent of magma and flame.  It is said that a great and long-dead wizard once tried to bind a flare beast to his will; he was successful, briefly, and then was overpowered, his body reduced to nothing by the white-hot storm of heat.
FLARE_BEAST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The flare beast's jaws open, unleashing a rain of fire.
ZEALOT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=zealot
ZEALOT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a zealot
ZEALOT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While all religions have their hard-edged adherents, the dark three take particular joy in cultivating zealots.  These men and women believe, and believe hard.  Not constrained by morality, society, or the rule of law, these people are willing to do anything to serve their deity.  This can include extortion, torture, murder - and worse.  Zealots exhibit a special kind of psychopathy.  For they often take no joy in their heinous acts, only a certain knowledge that their actions are meet and right.
ZEALOT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The zealot says nothing, her eyes hard and cruel.
BLOODLETTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bloodletter
BLOODLETTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bloodletter
BLOODLETTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the adherents of The Trickster, Vedere, and Voros long ago abandoned blood sacrifice, the practice has never left the adherents of Shiver, Urgoth, and Sceadugenga - indeed, those three deities demand it.  And it is believed that as a sacrifice, the blood of the living is far more valuable than that of the dead.  And so sacrifices are brought to these black altars, bound and struggling, and it is the bloodletters who spill their blood on the stones and watch as the struggles slowly cease.
BLOODLETTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bloodletter growls, "Your blood will wet this altar!"
DARK_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dark priest
DARK_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dark priest
DARK_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the black priests of Sceadugenga are marked by the bleeding mark on their forehead, the dark priests of Urgoth and Shiver are no less fearsome.  The pillars of their societies, the priests, in addition to their religious duties, act as judges and arbitrators, and their decisions are always binding.  Few would question them, and none openly, for their anger is quick and harsh, and with a few words they can call down divine power to smite their enemies.  For their life has been spent in servitude, and for this, they are given a dark and terrifying blessing.
DARK_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dark priest's eyes flash with fire.
BELIEVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=believer
BELIEVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a believer
BELIEVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Those who follow the dark three tend to hold stronger to their beliefs than those of the other Nine.  For their beliefs are unwelcome in most places, and they themselves persecuted.  The dark three are seen, right or wrong, as the reason for floods, droughts, and pestilence, and their adherents are often seen as black omens, and treated accordingly.
BELIEVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The believer shouts and sings praises.
DWARF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarf
DWARF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarf
DWARF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarves live deep within mountains, far below the naturally-occurring caverns and caves that serve as the entranceways.  They carve their cities from the rock itself, and mine the mountains for its ore.  They are short, about two-thirds the size of a human, but stocky, and disproportionately strong.  Dwarves are skilled with axes, hammers and crossbows.
DWARF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarf grunts, "Good day to you."
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven metallurgist
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven metallurgist
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarves are noted for their love of gold, and fine metals, and the metallurgist plays an important role in feeding these desires.  It is the metallurgist who works to develop processes to separate metals from the ore, to extract gold or iron or copper from the rock itself.  Due to the intense heats and strange chemicals involved, many dwarven metallurgists are assumed to be completely dotty, and few of them have done anything to dissuade the notion.
DWARVEN_METALLURGIST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven metallurgist squints at you.
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven stonecarver
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven stonecarver
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In their great underground fortresses, dwarves build massive rooms and halls.  But these are not unadorned.  Adorning them are decorative carvings, statues of ancient heroes, and other works of art.  And it is the job of the stone carver to create these.  Labouring for months, years, or sometimes even decades, they spend their days perched on scaffolding, working with a wide array of tools.  The end result is always beautiful: a work of art that, due to the lack of weather underground, can last tens of thousands of years.
DWARVEN_STONECARVER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven stonecarver regards you with bright eyes, her face caked with dust.
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven anklebiter
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven anklebiter
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarven men (and most dwarven women) are warriors of some sort, and their children from a young age learn to emulate them.  The dwarven anklebiter is a dwarf of a particular age, typically no more than three years old.  Barely able to walk, he teeters around wearing a tin pot for a helmet, and carries menacingly a large, leafy tree branch.
DWARVEN_ANKLEBITER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven anklebiter babbles and drools.
DWARVEN_MOTHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven mother
DWARVEN_MOTHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven mother
DWARVEN_MOTHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A common joke among the surface-dwelling races is that the difference between a dwarven man and woman is merely the length of the beard.  But this is unfair: dwarven women do not grow beards at all, and while they tend towards being stockier than human or elven women, they are certainly recognizably feminine.  Dwarven mothers, due to the rambunctiousness of their children, tend to dress in simple linen clothing, easily cleaned.  They are quick to anger, though, and will put their children firmly in their place with a sharp word or a cuff upside the head.
DWARVEN_MOTHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven mother smiles at you broadly.
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven warrior
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven warrior
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dwarven warriors tend to be stockier than other dwarves.  They also tend to be well-outfitted, wearing fine mail and axes from the dwarven smithies.  Dwarven warriors wear their hair and beards especially long, seeing it as a sign of strength in combat.  They keep these tucked loosely into their armour, so as not to catch or snag.  Dwarven warriors are the vanguard of the dwarven people against goblin and ogre raiding parties, and while the dwarves lack much in stature, they have proven to be more than capable against their foes.
DWARVEN_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven warrior grunts, "Tally ho!"
DWARVEN_HERO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven hero
DWARVEN_HERO_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven hero
DWARVEN_HERO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In a race characterized by a brave and bold nature, dwarven heroes stand out for their courage and fortitude.  They wear the finest dwarf-forged armour, their weapons given names in the dwarven tongue.  The veterans of many combats against goblin foes, dwarven heroes have earned the undying respect of their people.  Indeed, their names are spoken in awe over beer and whisky, their deeds recalled over lutes and lyre in the low-sung songs of the scops.
DWARVEN_HERO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven hero grunts a wordless salutation.
PEGASUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pegasus
PEGASUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pegasus
PEGASUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A semi-mythical creature that figures prominently in much ancient poetry, the pegasus is a white, winged horse capable of carrying its rider to the heavens.  Legends tell of heroes who have rode pegasi into battle, and the fear of their foes on seeing the pegasus flying towards them.  Their is much debate into the veracity of these tales; though many have tried to ride the pegasus, none in modern memory have succeeded.
PEGASUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pegasus rears and whinnies.
BOG_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bog devil
BOG_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bog devil
BOG_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In folklore, bog devils are evil spirits who carry away children beneath the marshy waters.  In reality, they are much more terrifying than this.  Resembling a half-eaten corpse, they rise from the fens to stalk the moors.  Their hair is stringy, and missing in clumps; they are often missing fingers, arms, or legs.  They are known to spit a terrible acid, capable of disfiguring their victims, and allowing the devil to feed while its victim writhes in pain.
BOG_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bog devil opens its mouth for a soundless scream.
LEVIATHAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=leviathan
LEVIATHAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a leviathan
LEVIATHAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The leviathan is king of the seas, a massive race of creatures old as time.  They are reptilian in appearance.  Called "sea-dragons" by some, most scholars agree that they are distinct species.  Leviathans live deep in the farthest waters, far from any civilization.  Throughout history, however, there have been tales of leviathans riding in on flood waters, calling lightning from the storm-clouds overhead, leaving death and destruction in their wake.
LEVIATHAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The leviathan roars, and the earth shakes.
DEMON_PRINCE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demon prince
DEMON_PRINCE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demon prince
DEMON_PRINCE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The denizens of the black plains self-organize into a strict hierarchy, the powerful enslaving the weak.  The most powerful of all are the demon princes.  They maintain demonic kingdoms, exerting their massive strength and cunning to bend the plains to their will.  They appear as monstrous humanoids, an amalgamation of many creatures: the head of a dragon, the wings of a griffin, the hooves of a bull.  They are clad in obsidian armour, and wield massive hammers that shimmer with chaos fire.  On their heads are crowns of fine platinum, are they are surrounded by an aura of blinding crimson fire.
DEMON_PRINCE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demon prince howls, "I will make you my slave in the world below!"
KESTREL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kestrel
KESTREL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kestrel
KESTREL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Kestrels are small hunting birds, similar and distantly related to their larger cousins, the falcon.  Kestrels display prominent mottled plumage, and have a sharply hooking beak, which they use to rip and tear at their prey.  Their small size, combined with their natural affinity for people, has meant that kestrels have often been domesticated, serving as quick messaging birds.
KESTREL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kestrel shrieks!
FROSTLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frostling
FROSTLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frostling
FROSTLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the smallest of the monsters, frostlings are the weakest servants of Shiver.  Looking like tiny elves or fae, they measure no more than a finger in height.  Though it is often said that they can fly, they cannot: they are blown in on cold air, and cause all kinds of mischief.  They steal rings and combs, spill wine, bite children, kill pets.  Though they are not always dangerous themselves, they are seen as a bad omen, and it is believed that where frostlings are seen, death and misfortune soon follow.
FROSTLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frostling titters.
SILVER_FISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=silver fish
SILVER_FISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a silver fish
SILVER_FISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Silver fish are the most common fish in the sea.  Their name comes from the silvery sheen of their scales, which at closer glance are flecked with red and black.  Silver fish grow up to two feet in length.  Travelling in great schools, they provide sustenance for the many fishing towns: fresh fish in the summer, salt fish in the winter.
SILVER_FISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The silver fish swims around.
SEAGULL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seagull
SEAGULL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seagull
SEAGULL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Seagulls are seabirds that nest on land and fly out to sea for food, feeding on fish that stray near the surface, and crabs that scuttle the beaches.  White-bodied, flecked with grey, seagulls are voracious eaters and quick to befriend men.  Though their diet is typically fish, seagulls will pick through people's trash for stale bread, meat scraps, and other scavengings.
SEAGULL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seagull sings overhead.
PELICAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pelican
PELICAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pelican
PELICAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Pelicans are large, long birds that feed on fish and build nests near shorelines.  They are instantly recognizable by their long, deep bills, with which they strike the water to catch their food.  Though there are several varieties of the bird, the most common is the white pelican, which have also been seen engraved surviving shards of ancient pottery, symbols of significance for some ancient and forgotten culture.
PELICAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pelican squawks!
JELLYFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=jellyfish
JELLYFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a jellyfish
JELLYFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Jellyfish are marine animals made up of a gelatinous substance.  They consist of two parts: a large, bell-like structure that can expand and contract for locomotion; and many thin, stinging tentacles.  The tentacles are their means of hunting.  Able to penetrate skin and even scales, they inject powerful venoms into the jellyfish's victim.  Fortunately, jellyfish are not quick creatures; without a strong current present, most will be able to simply swim away.
JELLYFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The jellyfish twists and turns, its tendrils sweeping the water.
SWORDFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=swordfish
SWORDFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a swordfish
SWORDFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Swordfish are large fish, and though they prefer warmer waters, they can be found throughout the world.  They grow more than six feet in length, and have a long, sword-like bill.  Swordfish use this to slash and cut, weakening their prey before catching and eating it.  Due to this excellent evolutionary weapon, they have few predators - the larger species of sharks are known to attack swordfish, along with the great octopi and jellyfish, but little else can stand up to them.
SWORDFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The swordfish parries and thrusts.
MERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=merman
MERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a merman
MERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Merfolk are an ancient race, one that myth says were created just after the elves, and made to roam the seas the way the elves roamed the land.  Mermen have the upper bodies of men, and the lower bodies of fish.  They are strong, and exceptionally brave in combat.  Mermen are typically armed with spears, tridents, and glaives, and armoured with bucklers and breastplates.
MERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The merman glances at you haughtily.
ELECTRIC_EEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=electric eel
ELECTRIC_EEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an electric eel
ELECTRIC_EEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient order of fish, electric eels resemble snakes, having a distinct lack of fins.  They tend to live in shallow water, as they actually breathe air, and must therefore return to the surface periodically to breathe.  Their electrical charge gives them a unique place within the ecosystem - though they are small enough to be eaten by a number of larger creaures, their electrical shock can be used effectively to counter that.  And so they are able to feed effectively, also using their charge to shock their prey, effectively disabling it prior to attacking.
ELECTRIC_EEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The electric eel swims around.
SQUID_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=squid
SQUID_DESCRIPTION_SID=a squid
SQUID_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Squids are cephalopods, having a distinct, elongated head, and eight tentacles.  Squid use these tentacles to grab their prey, holding it in place while they tear at it with their teeth.  Squid also have an effective self-defense mechanism: they are able to discharge a cloud of heavy ink, which distracts their predator, allowing the squid to retreat to deeper waters.
SQUID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The squid releases a puff of ink.
MERMAID_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mermaid
MERMAID_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mermaid
MERMAID_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Female merfolk are called mermaids: half woman, half fish, they have long enchanted sailors who have glimpsed them from their boats.  Little is known about mermaids, other than that they appear to enjoy human company, and attempt to entice men to join them in their homes beneath the water.  These men, captivated by the mermaids' beauty and nudity, last scant minutes before they drown.
MERMAID_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mermaid sings, "Come swim with me!"
GIANT_CRAB_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant crab
GIANT_CRAB_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant crab
GIANT_CRAB_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Giant crabs are are underwater arthropods that grow immensely large in size.  They are typically speckled red and white, though orange and even purple have been observed.  In some well-known older specimens, the legs have been measured to be more than seven feet in length.  Despite these massive legs, the body itself does not typically grow very large.  Because of this, the crab has less weight to support, and is quite nimble, able to move quickly and strike with incredible force using its claws.
GIANT_CRAB_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant crab scuttles towards you.
GREY_OCTOPUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=octopus
GREY_OCTOPUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=an octopus
GREY_OCTOPUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Related to the squid, the grey octopus is a cephalapod that inhabits a diverse range of areas: shallow and deep waters; warm, central seas and frigid arctic oceans.  It is also quite dangerous, having a powerful, wasting venom.  The grey octopus attacks by encirclement, catching its prey in its tentacles and using its beak to tear into its prey, injecting its venom.  The grey octopus usually feeds on shellfish, and among its few natural predators are the larger species of shark.
GREY_OCTOPUS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The octopus glides by, its tentacles curling as it passes.
BLACKFIN_SHARK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackfin shark
BLACKFIN_SHARK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackfin shark
BLACKFIN_SHARK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Of the many species of shark, the blackfin is the smallest, but most savage.  Growing to about four feet in length, these sharks are distinguished by their dark silver scales and black fins.  Despite their small size, they are very aggressive, attacking creatures many times their size.  They often attack in groups.  When they work together, they have been known to take down even the great whales of the southern seas, feasting on the massive carcasses and gorging before moving on.
BLACKFIN_SHARK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blackfin shark glides by, silver and black, a shadow in the water.
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wraith jellyfish
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wraith jelly fish
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The so-called "black death of the seas", the wraith jellyfish is uncommonly large and deadly.  It takes its name from its stuttering phospholuminesence: normally, it moves about in total darkness, but generates flickers of light, allowing it to appear only for short bursts, usually less than a second.  This flickering process lends it a ghostly impression.  Unlike most other jellyfish, the wraith jellyfish does not attack with powerful toxins.  Instead, it is able to store up electrical charges throughout its body, releasing massive electrical shocks into whatever touches it.
WRAITH_JELLYFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wraith jellyfish floats past you, flickering with an eerie light.
LANTERNFISH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lanternfish
LANTERNFISH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lanternfish
LANTERNFISH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange, deep-sea creature, the lanternfish is a massive carnivore with a rather strange feature.  It has a large antenna, bulbous at the tip, that lights up in darkness.  The lanternfish uses this to both seek out and lure prey, moving it about to resemble small prey fish.  Once it has closed with its prey, the lanternfish tears into it with many rows of sharp, hooked teeth.  Ultimately, what makes the lanternfish so dangerous is its size: growing ten feet in length, it is close in size to the larger sharks of the oceans.
LANTERNFISH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lanternfish glows with an unearthly light.
SIREN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=siren
SIREN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a siren
SIREN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sailors have long known that the months and years at sea cause a man to see strange things.  But throughout recorded history, there have been sightings of beautiful and beguiling women far out at sea.  They sit upon rocks, playing the lyre, singing wordless, spellbinding songs.  These women are called sirens, and their song is enchanting, especially to men who have not had the comfort of a woman in so long.  It is said that the pull of their music can cause a man to jump overboard and swim towards them - but the sirens never seem to get any closer, and the sailor swims til exhaustion, his body claimed by the waves.
SIREN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The siren begins to sing, her voice pure and enchanting.
STONE_WHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone whale
STONE_WHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone whale
STONE_WHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the smallest species of whale, the stone whale takes its name from the mottled grey appearance of its skin.  Stone whales grow to about thirty feet in length, and while not naturally aggressive, will defend themselves if startled.  Their tail is quick and powerful, capable of smashing through the hull of most ships, and can also be used to capsize smaller vessels.  Stone whales eat plankton and small crustaceans, and can dive to great depths in to escape from their predators.
STONE_WHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The stone whale releases a massive burst of water from its spout.
SEADRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seadragon
SEADRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seadragon
SEADRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Despite its name, the seadragon is actually a massive and ancient species of fish, growing twenty feet or more in length.  With an almost reptilian appearance and a fierce, aggressive nature, it took the name "seadragon" from the first fisher-folk.  This name has persisted, in some form or another, throughout history.  The seadragon is a deep-sea creature that occasionally rises higher in the ocean to hunt.  It moves quickly, and is known to prefer squid and octopus, which it can outpace, and jellyfish, to which it appears immune.
SEADRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seadragon opens its mouth, revealing rows and rows of teeth.
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mammoth turtle
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mammoth turtle
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mammoth turtles are thought to be a relic of days gone by, not nearly as numerous as the smaller, fragile, and more common turtles common throughout the world.  They can grow to many thousands of pounds, dwarfing men and even giants.  Though turtles lack gills, the mammoth turtle is an aquatic variety of turtle, and is known to swim the deep, swift ocean currents.  This allows them to travel quickly between far-flung parts of the world, and arrive back annually to their nesting grounds.  Though mammoth turtles are not instinctively hostile, they are quick to rile when approached, perhaps a more modern reaction to the peoples who use their flesh for soups and shells for jewellry and armour.
MAMMOTH_TURTLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mammoth turtle regards you with narrowed eyes.
WATER_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=water elemental
WATER_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a water elemental
WATER_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elementals are mindless servants of the Nine, formed and directed by divine will.  Water elementals appear as a massive torrent emerging from river or sea, stretching from the depths to the heavens.  They are capable of great destruction, capsizing or even destroying ships, and sending men to their death below.  Legends tell of ships that have sailed too far to the edge of the world; as punishment, the Nine sent elementals to rend the ships and slay the sailors.  The legends are less clear on how this was recorded, if, by divine will, there were to be no survivors.  Water elementals are believed to be used by Shiver and Vedere.
WATER_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The water elemental spins about you, a massive torrent, its roar deafening.
GREAT_EEL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=great eel
GREAT_EEL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a great eel
GREAT_EEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Great eels are a species of eel that can grow sixty feet or longer.  Nearly sightless, but patient, they swim about, waiting for a suitable meal.  Their scales are a dark green, an almost slime-like colour, and their teeth have an awful, yellowish hue.  They typically feed on large fish and crustaceans, though they are large enough and blind enough that when they catch men swimming in the water, they are unlikely to make the distinction.
GREAT_EEL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The great eel slithers by.
WATER_DEMON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=water demon
WATER_DEMON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a water demon
WATER_DEMON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Most denizens of the black plains are air-breathers, appearing on land in the mortal realm to sway travellers, tempt the righteous, and otherwise upset the world of men.  But there are some demons that swim the great icy seas.  These water demons appear to be the inhuman hybrid of man and reptile - they have the torso and limbs of a man, but with webbed fingers and toes, and a horrific reptilian head.  Water demons breathe a blast of icy water that slows their victims, allowing the demons to catch their prey and drag it down into the huge methane seas of the plains.
WATER_DEMON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The water demon whispers something in a bubbling, demonic tongue.
LION_SHARK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lion shark
LION_SHARK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lion shark
LION_SHARK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lion shark is the largest of the shark species.  It is named for a black ring on its scales that encircles its body, just behind the gills, resembling the look of a lion's mane.  Perhaps ironically named, the lion shark is a species that does not travel or work together; instead, they hunt alone, and are fiercely protective of their kills.  However, like the lions they are named for, lion sharks are fierce and very dangerous.  They are not afraid to attack swimmers near coastlines, and it is for this reason that they are hunted by many of the fisher-peoples.  Because of this, the population of lion sharks has been declining along coastlines, though it is reported that they are still common in the open ocean.
LION_SHARK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lion shark bares its teeth.
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=earth elemental
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=an earth elemental
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Servants of the Nine, and thought to be used by Urgoth and Sceadugenga, earth elementals appear as a shambling, giant-like form made entirely of stone.  Though somewhat slow moving, perhaps owing to their immense mass, these elementals are incredibly powerful, able to smash stone and steel.  They are unthinking and unspeaking, controlled by force of divine will, and do not rest until their purpose has been completed.
EARTH_ELEMENTAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The earth elemental steps towards you, the ground trembling beneath it.
ROOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rook
ROOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rook
ROOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rook belongs to the same family of birds as crows and ravens, and its distinguished from its cousins by the white of its beak.  A social bird, rooks typically hunt and nest in groups, and are quick to defend any companions that may be threatened.
ROOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rook caws.
BLUE_JAY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blue jay
BLUE_JAY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blue jay
BLUE_JAY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, vivid bird, the blue jay has bright blue plumage, with a white belly.  They feed on insects, seeds, and nuts, loving hazelnuts particularly, which they hide away for the long winter months.  They are noisy birds, but their song is not particularly beautiful, and they are often seen as a nuisance due to their thievery.
BLUE_JAY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blue jay chirps.
SHRIKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shrike
SHRIKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shrike
SHRIKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shrikes are a predatory bird, small, but dangerous.  They are fond of grasping their victims in their talons and impaling it on whatever they can find: brambles, sharp branches, and nearby rocks being the most common.  When their victim is too large to be moved, the shrike will instead attack ferociously, diving in and out quickly, attempting to bleed out its victim before feeding on the carcass.
SHRIKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shrike chirps.
FALCON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=falcon
FALCON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a falcon
FALCON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Falcons are large hunting birds, intelligent raptors that typically feed on small mammals.  Falcons have also shown a trainability that has long made them a favourite among the nobility, who enjoy them as a symbol of status and wealth, and train them to hunt upon command.
FALCON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The falcon shrieks!
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mountain elves are the first elves.  When the world was young, they made their settlements high in the mountains.  At some point, there was a migration into the world below, and these become the wood elves, but many chose to stay up in the peaks.  Mountain elves are tough and hardy, dressing in hides and furs, and fight with clubs, hammers, and slings rather than sword and bow.  They are less free-spirited but more wise than their woodland cousins, and have a deep love of learning.  
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf nods at you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elves share a common curiosity.  Wood elves enjoy crafting, the fae practice elder magics, and the mountain elves satisfy their curiosity through exploration.  Their villages are built into mountains, but still low enough that there is plenty of air.  Mountain elf explorers dress in fur coats made from bear and sheep, and climb the highest peaks, carving their names as they reach the summits.  They are extremely able climbers, climbing with little equipment save for a tent, sleeping roll, and a few other necessities.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf explorer exclaims, "Watch your step!"
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf spelunker
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf spelunker
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While most mountain elves are content to stay nearby their villages, or climb high above them, there are some whose curiosity drives them beneath the mountains themselves.  Armed with ropes and picks, they shimmy through the caverns and caves, mapping out the massive underground structures.  But this is a dangerous passion: many of the maps bear names such as "Ilvyn's Folly", or "The Drop of Bones".
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPELUNKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf spelunker grunts at you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf stonemason
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf stonemason
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mountain elves are well known for the quality of their stonework: massive fortresses, sturdy houses, and elegant carved inlays.  Mountain elf stonemasons build these structures and often do the artistic touches as well; it is expected that a good stonemason be able to contribute to all parts of the project.  Their hands tend to be incredibly hard and worn, and many walk with a limp or hunch from many years of hard labour.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_STONEMASON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf stonemason watches you closely.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf topographer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf topographer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While most races have no problems producing excellent, basic maps, it is agreed that the mountain elves excel at producing topographical maps.  Perhaps owing to their location high in mountains, mountain elf topographers, working with explorers, are able to produce incredibly precise maps showing height and terrain features.  These are valued by kings and commanders for showing excellent positions for fortifications and battles.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TOPOGRAPHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf topographer hails you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf vanguard
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf vanguard
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Despite their positions and fortifications high in the mountains, the mountain elves often find themselves under long siege from goblins and ogres.  In response to this, they have started to send a vanguard down to seek out raiders, skirmish, and retreat.  Those selected are chosen for their braveness, speed, and ability to make quick decisions.  Skirmishers wear very light armour, typically just layers of skins and leather, and carry only a hammer, club, or mace - enough to sneak in, crack some skulls, and then melt away.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SKIRMISHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf vanguard flashes you an ugly, toothless smile.
QUAKELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quakeling
QUAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quakeling
QUAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Living deeper than troglodytes, gnomes, and dwarves, the quakelings are deeply feared by each.  They lope slowly through underground caverns, squeeze themselves through crevices, and come to the upper world to hunt.  The size of a large bull, their bodies are hugely muscular, and their faces underdeveloped.  Perhaps due to the lack of light, their eyes are little more than tiny slits, but their huge jaws show rows of large, sharp teeth.  As they lope, the earth shakes noticably, and it is this quality of their terrifying movement that gives them their name.
QUAKELING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quakeling stamps its feet, and the earth shakes.
WOOD_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf
WOOD_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf
WOOD_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood Elves retreated into the forests millennia ago, building their civilizations in the treetops and branches.  Within the woods, they blend in with their surroundings, their clothing dyed deep shades of green and brown.  Wood Elves are skilled archers, and are known for their devotion to swordsmanship.
WOOD_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf says, "It is a beautiful day, is it not?"
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood elves do not have the ready access to ore that other races, such as dwarves, gnomes, or even humans do.  They set up small mines, and when they do find deposits, guard them carefully.  With the ore, they create swords of incredible function and beauty.  Some elves, captivated by this beauty, dedicate their lives to swordsmanship, carrying little more than a blade and the clothes on their back.  These swordsman are revered by the elves, and feared by outsiders, for they form the small and elite core of the elven armies.
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf swordsman looks at you distrustfully.
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf moneychanger
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf moneychanger
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though ivory is accepted all over the world, there are many currencies local to particular regions, from silver pieces to iron guilders to (in one case) aesthetically pleasing antelope skulls.  Moneychangers maintain a supply of the more important local currencies, and allow the conversion of one to another, at a particular rate, for a particular fee.  Many moneychangers are wood elves simply due to their distance from the world: many perceive wood elves to be the most fair, because they live so far apart from most other societies.  Wood elf moneychangers typically wear loose robes, their currencies hidden within in many tiny pockets, and often carry a small sword or rod for protection.
WOOD_ELF_MONEYCHANGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf moneychanger nods almost imperceptibly.
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf bowyer
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf bowyer
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Two of the most important roles in any elven village is that of the bowyers and fletchers.  Responsible for the creation of the bows and arrows that are so central to elven culture, these men and women take care in selecting the right tree, planting and tending to a new one to replace it, and then making the most use of the wood.  A great many of the bows are made from yew, hickory, or ash, depending on what is available nearby.  In addition to providing bows locally, many elven bowyers have found their skills in demand elsewhere, with elven bows being a symbol of pride and prestige throughout the rest of the world.
WOOD_ELF_BOWYER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf bowyer shakes your hand, his grasp uncommonly strong.
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf forester
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf forester
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Foresters play an important role among the elves.  They act as unofficial sentries and watchmen, keeping an eye on comings and goings even as they fell dead trees, clear and mark paths, and keep the underbrush tidy.  They often live in the wild for the entire summer, or even longer, returning only after the first snows make forest life inhospitable and cold.
WOOD_ELF_FORESTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf forester regards you wordlessly.
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf child
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf child
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood elf children have a great curiosity, part of the reason they are so adept at magic.  By the time they become adults, this has hardened into a distrust for the world beyond their borders, but the children remain keen and curious, excellent students but also prone to wandering to the fringes of the woods.  They appear slightly smaller than a human of the same age, but far slimmer, and move with much more grace.
WOOD_ELF_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf child laughs, "You must be an adventurer!  I can tell by your mismatched armour and ugly face!"
ILRU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Leader of the Yew Wood Elves, Ilru has seen hundreds of summers pass in the old forest.  A proud man entering into old age, Ilru's long red hair is streaked with grey, his face testament to his years.  He wears a rough green shirt and a leather cape, and tucks a simple knife into his belt.
ILRU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ilru nods at you.  "Welcome, traveller.  This is the Forest of Yew."
FALIR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young wood-elf dressed in a loose grey robe, Falir looks much older than his years.  His voice has withered to a whisper; he walks slowly, with purpose; and an ugly purple scar runs from his forehead down to his ear.  His green eyes are cat-like and piercing in the low light.  Falir clutches a twisted wooden staff between his hands.
FALIR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Falir speaks in a soft tone.  "You have done well to find us here.  This forest is very deep and deceptive."
LALO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in fine armour beneath a dark green cloak, clutching a glowing white spear, Lalo watches keenly from beneath his cowl.  A wood elf with dark red hair and nut-brown skin, Lalo's face is harsh and pale.  His eyes are steel-grey and unblinking, and his lips form a thin frown; his veins bulge against impossibly thin skin.  Underneath the fine mail, Lalo's movements are quick and precise, and his voice conveys a keen intelligence and authority.
LALO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lalo murmurs, "You will make a suitable slave in the next life."
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Perhaps owing to their long life and natural curiosity, wood elves with a talent for magic rarely limit themselves to a single subject.  Equally capable as wizards, oracles, and pilgrims, many choose the long road of the sage, spending many years acquiring a broad depth of knowledge.  They spend their days inside, reading.  Their nights are spent in candlelight, hunched over ancient texts and in prayer to the Nine.  They are much frailer in appearance than other elves, taking little food and wine, and often are particularly gaunt in appearance.
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf sage says, "Knowledge is geography - it must be charted for future generations."
LICHLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lichling
LICHLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lichling
LICHLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sages speak of black sorceries practiced long ago, magics that could raise the dead from their rest.  Some students have tried to study this magic.  Most become mad, wandering the world, speaking of black devils, sea-demons, tendrils in the night.  But some, a few, are able to force their way into this realm.  These magi become filled with unnatural powers, able to command the darkness and foul creatures, able to fell the living and raise the dead with but a word.  The initiates are called lichlings, and live somewhere between life and death.  Gaunt and grey, their flesh festers with open sores, and their teeth are full of rot.  Their hair takes on a putrid brown-grey appearance, and their movements become slow and arthritic.  But beneath their robes, their eyes burn, their minds becoming slowly corrupted by the powers they unlocked.
LICHLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lichling hisses, and you can smell decay in its breath.
GREY_GLIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The grey gliders are the recently dead who have been infused with spells of life and lifting.  The magic drains all colour from them: from their skin, their death shrouds, and any possessions.  This process makes them a startling dark grey in appearance.  As well, grey gliders do not walk.  Their magic grants them the ability to glide inches above the ground, allowing them to silently stalk their victims before delivering the fatal bite with their sharpened teeth.
GREY_GLIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The grey glider's lips twist back into an ugly smile.
GHOUL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghoul
GHOUL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghoul
GHOUL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ghouls are animated corpses.  Raised by more powerful magic than the thrall, ghouls are quick and nimble, much faster than they appear.  Instead of fingers, they have talon-like claws, and unlike the thrall, ghouls are nearly silent.  The black magic robs them of their voices.  They are often seen with their mouths open in a silent scream, the only sound being a slow, quiet hiss.
GHOUL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghoul releases a hiss of fetid air.
CORPSE_BIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Corpse birds come from the same family as crows and ravens.  They are smaller than crows, though their talons are larger, and their beaks longer.  Their eyes have a strange red rim about them.  Though corpse birds are social, and often seen in groups, it is when they are seen alone that people are most troubled.  Many have passed down stories in which the sudden appearance of a corpse bird, and its cackle-like laugh, have foreshadowed a sudden death.
CORPSE_BIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse bird caws.
QUISLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quisling
QUISLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quisling
QUISLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Treacherous, lesser demons from the black plains, quislings superficially resemble men and women.  On closer inspection, they have two key differences: they have a ram's legs rather than a humands, and nubby horns at the edge of their forehead.  To hide their appearance and walk among men, they wrap themselves in long, hooded cloaks.  They do not wear boots, however, and the sign of hooves or the tell-tale sound they make is quick to betray them.  Quislings speak in soft, assuring tones, purporting to help people before turning on them in a vicious rage to drag their souls into the world below.
QUISLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quisling smiles, "I see a great future for you, adventurer.  A glittering career."
KIRIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kirin
KIRIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kirin
KIRIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mountain elves value skill in battle and strong leadership over bloodlines.  Because of this, Kirin's ascension to rule was swift.  He fought as a foot soldier against ogre invaders, loosing boulders and skirmishing on the narrow mountain paths.  His skill with the unwieldy stone club became well-known, and he was soon commanding a small band of elves that held off a force ten times their size.  After the ogres were driven to the sea and destroyed, he became leader of Atua-Elar, showing good judgement and wisdom during the ensuing years of peace.
KIRIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kirin says, "Welcome to the mountains, adventurer.  This is the village of Atua-Elar."
AKKARA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akkara
AKKARA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akkara
AKKARA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Akkara is a young woman, at least by elven standards; tall for her race, with light brown hair and green eyes.  She wears simple linen clothing underneath a blue-grey shawl.  Despite her simple appearance, her expression is quick, and piercing; a brilliant student, Akkara learned how to read and write very early.  Once she mastered the elven language, she taught herself geography, mathematics, and wizardry in the stone carrels of the old library.  After leaving for a time to study in the great central cities, she returned, full of knowledge, bringing with her a cart full of texts.  Once settled, she was made librarian and headmistress, spending her days teaching the children, and her evenings reading by candlelight.
AKKARA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Akkara smiles. "Welcome to the library of Atua-Elar!  This is the history room."
TWILLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Twille
TWILLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Twille
TWILLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Twille wears simple elven clothing: cotton, earth-toned, a little loose, as if he has lost a fair amount of weight since they were made.  And he is certainly thin.  Middle-aged, his red-and-grey hair drawn back into a long ponytail, he has the look of one who has spent a long life reading.  For warmth he wears an old, brown overcoat, lined with pockets.  These are stuffed with all manner of things.  White swan-quills erupt in threes or fours, sharing space with scroll cases and scraps of blotting paper.  Small bulges within suggest ink pots, or perhaps sealing wax.
TWILLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Twille says softly, "This has been my life - here in this library, in the carrels, one book after another, poetry and history and prose."
TWILLE_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="My classmates grew up, grew older.  Found lovers.  Had children.  But our choices necessarily mean that we all leave something behind."
TWILLE_SPEECH3_TEXT_SID="I have known emperors and kings, priests, peasant poets.  Empires come and gone.  Greatness by reference; words in the dark."
ILIRI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Iliri
ILIRI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Iliri
ILIRI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Middle aged, gaunt, with high cheekbones and a stern expression, Iliri acts as one of the scribes of the library of Atua-Elar.  Borrowing books from passing scholars, he works late into the night making copies for the library's collection.  A scholarly man, Iliri's interests tend towards the arcane, and he has built up the library's collection of magical works over the course of several years.
ILIRI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Iliri whispers, "This is the room of secrets, home to our small collection of arcane manuscripts."
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf scholar
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf scholar
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=From a young age, the wood elves train in swordsmanship and archery.  Mountain elves, too, train for combat, but they also ensure academic training, and the learned are held in the same esteem as the mighty.  The scholars spend their days reading old texts, practicing their penmanship, and developing their ideas about geometry, history, and literature.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SCHOLAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf scholar looks up from his book.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf youth
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf youth
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While mountain elves spend the early parts of their days in school, learning literacy, history, and other subjects, the rest of the day they are expected to spend drilling fighting, helping out their households, and other such tasks.  In practice, this is not always the case.  Many youths spend this time exploring the mountains, hunting goat and horned sheep, and spelunking.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_YOUTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf youth grins.  "Want to come goat hunting?"
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf brewer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf brewer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In the mountains, the summers are cool, the winters desperately cold.  The mountain elves warm themselves with furs and peat fires, but also with copious amounts of spirits.  They prefer gin, harvesting the berries of the juniper, and using this in combination with herbs and flowers to flavour the alchol.  Mead is also popular, though honey is scarce, so it is made less often.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_BREWER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf brewer asks, "Care to try a sample?  There are taps on the barrels!"
TIR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tir
TIR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tir
TIR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When mountain elves feel the pull of adventure, typically they move up or inward, exploring peaks and caves.  But there are some who take their chances with the outside world.  Tir is a young man, dressed in wool and wolf-skins, a short spear and a backpack slung across his back.  He looks particularly weather-beaten: his dark red hair is long, almost waist-length, dry and cracked from the wind; his face is a map of scars; and he seems to have chipped several teeth.  Despite this, he appears to be in remarkably good spirits, his eyes twinkling, his mouth caught in an unconscious smile.
TIR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Tir says, "I've just come back from the far west, from the edge of the world.  I found an island full of ogres; I crept in by night, and saw something."
TIR_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="It was an amulet of some sort, a thing of great beauty.  It is too beautiful for ogre-folk; I wonder whose it is?"
AKOJO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akojo
AKOJO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Akojo
AKOJO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Captain of a raiding party, Akojo is a slight goblin.  Smaller than his kinfolk, he nevertheless lean and muscled.  He refuses heavy armour, preferring to wear a simple leather jerkin and wristguards, and a jagged, curved sword hangs from his waist.  Unlike other goblins, who rise in rank by physical strength and brutality, Akojo became a captain through guile, cunning, and stealth.  His raiding parties are always successful; his ship, The Black Shadow, never lacks for crew.
AKOJO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Akojo glares at you from a face awash with scars.
COUGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cougar
COUGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cougar
COUGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large breed of cat, the cougar is smaller than other cats such as the tiger or lion, but larger than the lynx.  Cougars are wide-spread, living in forests, grasslands, and mountains.  Cougars feed on whatever mammals they can find: rabbit, fox, deer, even wild horses and rams.  Their fur ranges from light to dark brown, and a full-grown adult can grow to be more than two hundred pounds.  Cougars are known to be aggressive towards people, particularly when hungry.
COUGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cougar emits a strange sound, somewhere between a whine and growl.
MAWGRAWL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mawgrawl
MAWGRAWL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mawgrawl
MAWGRAWL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mawgrawls are hideous, primeval creatures from the early days of the world.  Resembling massive worms, they grow sixty feet or more, with a diameter that can exceed six feet.  Their flesh is a dull greenish-grey, and their maws drip with a powerful acid.  Mawgrawls dissolve and then engulf their prey, absorbing their nutrients before burrowing back into the earth.
MAWGRAWL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mawgrawl rears up and sways.
QUEEN_BEE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=queen bee
QUEEN_BEE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a queen bee
QUEEN_BEE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In normal bee colonies, the queen bee is not particularly dangerous or aggressive, but for larger varieties of bees, the queen bee's diet of royal jelly causes her to not only to become the largest in the colony, but also the most aggressive and volatile.  These queens leave the hive, and will attack anything that crosses their path.  Unlike the worker bees, whose stingers become detached when used, the queen bee's remains firmly in place, allowing her to attack repeatedly with her potent and deadly poison.
QUEEN_BEE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The queen bee buzzes angrily.
LION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lion
LION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lion
LION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the largest of the great cats, lions prowl the grasslands and savannahs, the prey of no beast.  Lions live in groups called prides, and hunt the great roaming herds of large mammals, culling the young, the sick, and the elderly.  Growing to hundreds of pounds, lions' claws are capable of slicing through small trees, their massive jaws capable of biting through mail.  Lions are a symbol of power and strength, and figure prominently in the heraldry of the royal houses.
LION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lion roars.
CAVE_TIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The largest member of the cat family, cave tigers prowl the caves and caverns of the mountainsides, occasionally coming down to the fields and forests when times are lean.  Usually a foot higher than a lion, and several feet longer, cave tigers' colouring matches their natural habitat.  Their fur is a sandy brown, offering a degree of camouflage in mountain settings.  Perhaps their most startling feature is their jaws: two massive fangs extend from their upper jaw beyond the lower, providing them a terrifying way with which to gore, main, and kill their prey.
CAVE_TIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave tiger roars.
LIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=liger
LIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a liger
LIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A hybrid of lion and tiger, bred for its ability with magic, the liger closely resembles a lion with a tiger's colouring.  Something in the breeding process centuries ago awoke something: a low sentience, perhaps, and one that was strangely attuned to the primordial energies of the world.  As a result, ligers attack with the ferocity of a beast, but with the arcane energies of a sorceror.  Ligers are greatly prized among wizards; if tamed, the beasts are considered among the greatest of familiars.
LIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The liger whines, a high-pitched, siren-like sound.
GOLIATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goliath
GOLIATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goliath
GOLIATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Towering above the cyclopes, the colossi, and even the heavenly titans, the goliaths are massive creatures from before recorded time.  They sleep underneath mountains, deep in caverns - anywhere where they can find rest.  It is said they were among the first creations on the world, and it was through their footsteps that the world took shape.  Goliaths are so tall that they can into the heavens to throw lightning, smiting their foes before retreating back to their rest.
GOLIATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goliath's speech rumbles like thunder in a long-forgotten tongue.
SEA_SERPENT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sea serpent
SEA_SERPENT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sea serpent
SEA_SERPENT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Distant (and, some think, early) relations to dragons, the sea serpents are massive beasts that live deep within underground caves and caverns.  Monstrous creatures that grow hundreds of feet in length, they rise to hunt shark, and whale - and ship.  Stories have been told how, in the dead of night, a sea serpent has coiled around the hull of great wooden ships, smashing the decks with its head eating the men below.  The serpents are said to breathe destruction, like dragons, though instead of fire, their breath is frost and ice.
SEA_SERPENT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sea serpent raises its head to the heavens and releases an unearthly roar.
NICOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nicor
NICOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nicor
NICOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An enormous sea-monster, the nicor has the body of a great reptile, and five monstrous heads.  It patrols the depths, using its limbs and tails to swim quickly; these resemble long, broad flippers.  Ancient poems have written about this creature as the guardian of a great undersea evil, the cavern inhabited by the mother of a great monster.  The nicor is wrathful, a beast of pure hate and destruction: its heads spew flame and ice and vile poisons, and it fights with such ferocity that none can stand in its way.
NICOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nicor's five heads gnash and roar.
WHITE_WHALE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=white whale
WHITE_WHALE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a white whale
WHITE_WHALE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There are many species of whale throughout the world, but the largest is the white whale.  Despite its massive size, the white whale eats mainly plankton and crustaceans, ignoring the many species of fish that thrive in the cold waters.  Growing more than a hundred feet long, it is known to prefer the frigid waters of the far north and south.  It is prized by the skraelings that live nearby - its skin is used for clothing, its blubber an important food and heating source, and its bones used to create arrows, spears, and other tools.
WHITE_WHALE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The white whale swims past.
BUNYIP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bunyip
BUNYIP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bunyip
BUNYIP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In hushed tones, the aboriginal peoples speak of a great creature, a monster that lives in marshes and rivers, in shallow sea-beds.  This beast is called a bunyip, and no two descriptions of it are the same: some say it has scales, some fur, and some say the skin is hairless.  But it is agreed that the creature is fearsome and fearless, snatching great beasts in its jaws and dragging them down to the waters below.
BUNYIP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The bunyip hisses softly, the sound like gas coming off a marsh.
KRAKEN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=kraken
KRAKEN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a kraken
KRAKEN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sailors whisper of a creature found deep beneath the waves, a massive, octopus-like creature so huge it is said to have torn ships apart, and clasped a dozen men with a single tentacle.  The name given to this beast is "kraken".  Scholars have long discussed this creature, and included it within their bestiaries, but the lack of firsthand accounts remains troubling - despite the protestations of the sailors who claim to have witnessed it, it is agreed by the scholars involved that the word of sailors is not worth a great deal.
KRAKEN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kraken flails its tentacles high in the air, and blots out the sun.
DEMOGORGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Demogorgons are primordial spirits, immortal and incredibly powerful.  They travel at will not just through the world, but through time and space as well.  Many a man has been seduced by the supposed secrets whispered in his ear by these ancient creatures, told of ancient magics and future discoveries, driven mad by the unrealizable torrent of knowledge.  When demogorgons take physical form, they appear as massive, multi-headed beasts, each head whispering truths and falsehoods.  As they are immortal, they cannot be killed; when their physical form perishes, it releases the spirit, which travels away before reforming again.
DEMOGORGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demogorgon's voice echoes soundlessly in your head.
BLOOD_HAWK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blood hawk
BLOOD_HAWK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blood hawk
BLOOD_HAWK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, savage bird, the blood hawk is so named for the appearance of its large talons after killing its prey.  While other birds tend to attack with the beak, the blood hawk is notable for its reliance upon its talons.

BLOOD_HAWK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blood hawk shrieks!
ROC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=roc
ROC_DESCRIPTION_SID=the roc
ROC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A beast of myth and legend, the roc is said to have a wingspan to blot out the sun, with feathers of fire and silver and gold.  The few reported sightings tend to be shipwrecked sailors, who claim the great bird capable of rending a ship like paper, leaving them to their doom.  There have been no sightings among the civilized peoples of the world, and as such, the roc remains a story in the eyes of most.
ROC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The roc emits a deafening shriek!
QUAALIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quaalis
QUAALIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quaalis
QUAALIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of ancient myth, the quaalis are said to dwell on massive mountain peaks.  Covered in a permanent layer of frost and ice, they appear almost as statues, their long feathers giving the appearance of armour.  But once they move, they do so with great speed, swooping down towards their prey to grab them in their talons and dash them against the mountainside.  The quaalis are featured prominently in ancient ruins, their images carved into stone to watch high over the dead.
QUAALIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quaalis shrieks, emitting a gale of ice and snow.
SATYR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=satyr

SATYR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of legend and myth, satyrs combine the features of goats and men.  They have the upper body of a man, save for a small pair of goat's horns; their legs are those of a goat, and they have short tails as well.  Satyrs are often heard before they are seen.  Musical creatures, they love the sound of their reed flutes and pipes, which they carry with them everywhere. 
SATYR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The satyr grins at you, and plays its pipes.

BLACK_MANTICORE_DESCRIPTION_SID=the black manticore
BLACK_MANTICORE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The black manticore is a huge beast that resembles a lion, but has a human head with cold, green eyes.  Its fur is short and hard, shiny, and black as charcoal.  An intelligent creature, the black manticore can speak many tongues, able to switch between elven and dwarven, gnomish and the many languages of man.  Its voice is light and airy.  Survivors have told of its timbre resembling pan pipes whistling in the wind.
BLACK_MANTICORE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black manticore chimes, "You are not welcome here.  Say what prayers you will."
ARMOURED_BEETLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large insect with a hard, almost metallic shell, the armoured beetle takes its name from its carapace.  Feeding on grubs and small vertebrates, the armoured beetle lives deep underground, making its home within the soils and caverns of the world.
ROCK_ADDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rock adder hisses slowly.
ROCK_ADDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rock adder is a venomous snake that lives in crevices and cracks, out of the sunlight.

ACOLYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an acolyte
ACOLYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The acolyte murmurs, "Praise be."
ACOLYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Novices of their faiths, acolytes exist for all of the Nine.  They tend to the worship sites, help priests with their tasks, and spend long hours studying holy books.  They typically leave their homes at a young age.  Some take up residence in towns and villages, while others follow the call to the far ends of the world.  Regardless of the route they take, acolytes spend many years in service before becoming blessed priests.
FOX_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox
FOX_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox
FOX_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small mammal, the common red fox is a carnivore that feeds on rabbits, mice, and other such creatures.  Known for their stealth and cunning, foxes prefer to avoid the company of people, who have been known to hunt and eat the creature when food becomes scarce.
FOX_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox yips.
LARGE_ANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=large ant
LARGE_ANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a large ant
LARGE_ANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The large ant is well known as a particularly large member of the artropod family.  Far dwarfing most other insect species, the large ant grows to the size of a man's fist.  And with the increased size comes an increased confidence: large ants feed on small mammals, such as mice and rabbits, and have been known to attack to work in groups to attack unwary adventurers.
LARGE_ANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The large ant rubs its mandibles in anticipation.
CHRISTOF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, barrel-chested gnome, Christof is the elected leader of the Gnordvar gnomes, bearing the title of "Chancellor".  Beneath his surcoat he wears a shirt of fine, gnomish mail, and a jewelled short sword hangs from his waist.  Many years ago, during a goblin raid, Christof repelled the invaders with a small band of his kinfolk, catching the goblins in a narrow mountain trail.  The gnomes destroyed all but a single goblin, sending it back to spread the tale.  Gnordvar has had little trouble with sea-raiders since.
CHRISTOF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Christof exclaims, "Visitors!  How delightful!"
ELFRIC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small, even for a gnome, and very frail, Elfric looks caught somewhere between middle- and old-age.  His beard is long, and unkempt, streaked with grey as well as leaves and twigs.  He wears a tattered, red robe.  Within it, he keeps all manner of powders, metals, and herbs, the base ingredients of his alchemy.
ELFRIC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Elfric whispers, "I require magnesium ore for my flash-powders, but the mines are so dangerous and full of beasts!"
ALFREDO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tall and slender, an adventurer by trade, Alfredo carries his world on his back.  A large leather backpack has been stuffed with clothes and rations, a sleeping roll, and a small tent.  A small stabbing sword hangs from his belt.  His skin is tanned a deep nut-brown by the sun, and his bright eyes twinkle as he talks, mirroring an unconscious half-smile.
ALFREDO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alfredo grimaces. "The mines have been overrun! Christof sent me to investigate, but what lurks there is too strong for me!"
GNOMISH_SAILOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish sailor
GNOMISH_SAILOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish sailor
GNOMISH_SAILOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=
GNOMISH_SAILOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish sailor says, "Saw a strange sight out by a rocky island far south-east.  Looked like an old man - what's he doing out there?"

GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the gnomish barkeeper
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Smartly dressed in a leather apron and a crisp, pressed shirt, his hair neatly oiled and parted, the gnomish barkeeper provides welcome relief to the miners of Gnordvar.  He serves up ale, stout, and whisky from huge barrels behind the bar, always appreciative when patrons tip a little extra.
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish barkeeper queries, "Will you have whisky, or beer?"
GNOME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnome
GNOME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnome
GNOME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.  They are intelligent and quick; gnomes love riddles and puzzles, and have a deep affinity for magic.  In combat, they show skill with knives and other short blades.
GNOME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnome says, "The underground's getting rather dangerous lately.  Wonder what it is?"
GNOMISH_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a foot and a half high, the gnomish child's clothes are torn and stained, its hair a mess of leaves and dirt.  The child has either lost or abandoned its shoes, and its feet are tanned the same deep brown as the rest of it.  Its pockets look to be teeming: with bugs and worms, shiny stones, and anything else that has captured its attention, however briefly.
GNOMISH_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish child stares at you with huge eyes. "Can I have some candy?"
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish adventurer
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish adventurer
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among adventurers, it's acknowledged that there are far more gnomes in their profession than in society as a whole.  Though gnomes often keep to their own towns and villages, a large number of them seem to have a natural curiosity that carries them elsewhere.  Gnomes, like dwarves, love being underground, and many think that the disproportionate number of gnomish adventurers is a combination of natural gnomish curiosity, their love of gems, and the siren call of dungeons and ruins to adventurers everywhere.
GNOMISH_ADVENTURER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish adventurer doffs his cap.
GNOMISH_MINER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Delving deep beneath the earth, hauling ore and gems to the surface, the gnomish miner lives a life in near darkness.  Caked with coal-dust, sweat, and grime, his skin has taken on a greyish hue.  His eyes narrow, squinting, his vision decimated by a life spent underground.  But despite these maladies, with thick, heavy arms, and a broad chest, the gnome looks more like a dwarf, stocky and powerful.
GNOMISH_MINER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish miner says, "My father was a peat-cutter, and I have no spade to follow him.  But I've got my pick; I'll dig with that."
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall man, towering over the gnomes he serves, Theodoric built and maintains the small stone temple in Gnordvar.  After studying as an acolyte in the inner isles, Theodoric was granted a boat and told to make harbour wherever he was needed.  He sailed east, and arrived in Gnordvar a dozen years ago.  With the blessing of its people, he built a temple for the village, and now leads a simple life of prayer and healing among the smallest people of the world.
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Theodoric smiles. "All of Vedere's creatures are welcome here, in our humble temple."
LIGHTNING_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Large, flying insects that glow brightly, lightning bugs store charges of electricity.  They are typically harmless, but will fight back when provoked, and the strength of their electrical charge is so great that it has been known to cause temporary paralysis.
LIGHTNING_BUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lightning bug buzzes and flickers.
GOBLIN_PELTER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin pelter
GOBLIN_PELTER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin pelter
GOBLIN_PELTER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins as a whole are wretchedly poor.  Their knives are often sharpened sticks, or bits of stone, and lacking the money or expertise to create the great bows and crossbows favoured by the other races, they turn to a simple and effective method: stones.  Whether flung by hand or launched from a sling, goblin pelters turn the ubiquitous projectile into something deadly, capable of stunning, cracking bones, and ushering a quick trip to the grave.
GOBLIN_PELTER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin pelter idly tosses and catches a stone.
FROST_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small creatures of cold and ice, frost devils travel on freezing winds, culling the sick and infirm, the very young, the dying.  Barely a foot high, they resemble tiny children.  Their skin has a white-grey hue, and their eyes are a bright, startling blue.  They are ferocious.  Knowing no fear, they attack creatures many times their size, slowing them with a bite of terrible, numbing cold.
FROST_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frost devil screams, and a cold wind surrounds you.
FIRE_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of an older time, fire devils live deep within the earth, far past the homes dug by the dwarves and gnomes, with whom they war constantly.  Beings of intense mischief, fire devils arise from cracks and canyons to wreak havoc on living things, igniting with their touch and leaving little but cinders and char, their high-pitched laughs echoing behind.
FIRE_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire devil cackles, and its flames flicker and dance.
AMAUROSIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient wyrm, the last of his kind, Amaurosis lives deep within the caverns of the barren northwest isle.  His body is impossibly long; his mind is even more cunning.  Born of chaotic magics as the world just began, he ravaged the peoples of the world twice in recorded history, finally sealed back by the great warlocks of old.  But as their numbers dwindled, so too did his seal, and it is said that thunder and smoke fill the air once more.
AMAUROSIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient wyrm emits a piercing shriek, causing the caverns to rumble.
EAKAURI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Eakauri
EAKAURI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Eakauri
EAKAURI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Legend has it that the faerie people were all but annihilated when they fought the giants, the remaining few fae fading into the woods and wild.  The truth is that before recorded time, a fiery star crashed into the earth, and contained within this star was a fearsome creature: Eakauri, the undying.  Standing fifty feet tall, it moves with the lithe grace of a housecat, while having the strength of twenty titans.  Its skin is thick and rocky, its eyes glowing like coals.  It has no mouth, but instead speaks telepathically in the language of the subject.  The faerie people rallied for survival, raising powerful armies of sorcerors, bowmen, and swordsmen.  Eventually, Eakauri was defeated, and as punishment imprisoned for eternity in the undersea prison Eka.
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=-So, there was a key after all.  Do you know how long I have lived beneath the sea?  It is but a moment for me, and immeasurable for you.-
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=-The fair folk bound me here with their fey magics.  Forced to fester, I have spent tens of thousands of years here in this room.-
EAKAURI_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=-I am Eakauri the undying.  I will have my revenge, and I will start with you!-
FISHERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fisherman
FISHERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fisherman
FISHERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Where there are lakes, rivers, and oceans, there are fisherman: simple, honest folk who feed their families and peoples through the bounty of the waters.  They travel in coracles and skiffs, dromonds and longboats, alone or in teams, fishing with line, nets, and spears.  Salt fish is a common winter staple among many people, who rely on stores of it to see them through to spring.
FISHERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fisherman says, "Good weather, fair winds.  I'll be setting sail soon."
SEAWIFE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seawife
SEAWIFE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seawife
SEAWIFE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Fishermen are married to the open water, but those that take wives must leave them regularly in search of their catch. The seawives tend to the home in the absence of their husbands; they mend clothes and nets, raise the children, and salt the last trip's fish.
SEAWIFE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seawife says, "Each time my husband goes to sea, he leaves me stranded in the shoals."
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A smug, simpering creature, the ploughman brags and boasts of his importance within society.  Immortalized by the colloquy of a certain monk, he is less appreciated by his fellow villagers, who see the man as useful, but still an insufferable git.
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ploughman gloats, "Whose grain makes the loaf? Whose turnips make the mash? The ploughman's!"
THE_BLACKSMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=the blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Due to the recent publication of a colloquy on the occupations, the blacksmith's prominent place in society is suddenly under attack.  Formerly lionized for his skills, for crafting weapons of war and implements of peace alike, for smithing spears and shoeing horses, the blacksmith now must fight for respect after a particular monk declared that "the ploughman feeds us all."
THE_BLACKSMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blacksmith scoffs, "That miserable, braggart ploughman!  Who hews his hoe?  Who smelts his steel?"
SMALL_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=small child

VILLAGE_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste, maintains a small church within the village of Isen Dun, leading nightly prayers and tending to the sick and wounded.

VILLAGE_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Oswyn intones, "Hail Celeste, empress of heaven, by whose will all things are made."
CYNWISE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An older, childless woman, Cynwise lives at the fringes of Isen Dun.  One of the few villagers with any magical training, Cynwise provides protection for the villagers from the seabound raiders, able to call upon the elements and harness deeper energies.  Still, these powers have made her frightening among her own people, who both respect and fear her.  Not quite an outsider, but not accepted either, Cynwise spends most of her days tending to her books and studies.
CYNWISE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cynwise murmurs, "A poor omen, this cold wind. Do you feel it, %s? Bitter as dragon's breath..."
KEW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A grizzled old adventurer, Kew's glory days are years behind him.  A tall, well-built man with snow-white hair, Kew wears an ornate dagger at his waist as the only indication of his life that was.
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kew says, "The dead are sometimes buried with their favourite possessions."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT2_SID=Kew muses, "I have heard the Nine like sacrifices, and reward their champions with immeasurable power."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT3_SID=Kew grins.  "If you want to make your name, you'll want to get off this island.  Hrothgar might give you a key, if you help him."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT4_SID=Kew says, "I'm old, but that just means I'm alive.  Remember, you don't have to fight everything you see!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT5_SID=Kew says, "It's important to always have ways to escape bad situations.
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT6_SID=Kew reminds you, "Don't panic, and always consider your options."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT7_SID=Kew laughs, "Swords and spears are wonderful, but you're letting people awfully close.  It never hurts to carry a bow, as well!"
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT8_SID=Kew says, "Some armour may provide you with resistances.  Don't ignore these - they will keep you alive when the heaviest plate fails."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT9_SID=Kew says, "Tanneries, forges, looms - if you aren't happy with your own equipment, perhaps you could craft something new."
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT10_SID=Kew says, "The Nine all have their individual likes and dislikes.  Hope you've been paying attention at your services!"
KEW_SUPPLIES_SPEECH_SID=Kew laughs, "Traveller, you will need more than that to stay alive! Take this key, and help yourself to my old equipment."
CADLIND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cadlind
CADLIND_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cadlind
CADLIND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Moon-faced and slender, Cadlind is somewhere at the balance between adulthood and middle age.  A lifetime outdoors has left her skin tanned nut-brown, and her long, dirty blonde hair is streaked with salt and silver.  She pins it back with a scrimshaw brooch, the ivory engraved with a great, white whale.  Her clothes are shabby.  Her boots show a number of toes, the leather bleached and faded, the stitching badly in need of repair.  Around her shoulders she wears a bear skin shawl, and her right hand idly grips a briar axe.
CADLIND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cadlind says, "Isn't adventuring glorious?  I'm just stopping here briefly, and then I'm off again.  I've found a couple of very strange places nearby."

NAMA_DESCRIPTION_SID=Nama
NAMA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A very elderly man, rough-robed and disshevelled, Nama lives in exile from his former land.  Having taken up residence in the fields and cliffs of the little island, he devotes himself to the naming of things: what they are called, and what they call themselves.  He carries a massive, leatherbound text, and deep within the folds of his cloak, he carries an ink pot and a multitude of quill pens.  These he fashions from many birds: pelicans, geese, terns, and for his smallest pens, songbirds such as sparrows and starlings.
NAMA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Nama looks up from his book, a massive, illuminated tome.
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Nama looks up from his tome.  "Look, over there - that sparrow.  You and I, we call it a sparrow, but is that any name for such a lovely thing?"
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH2_TEXT_SID="I record the true names of things.  There used to be many people like me, in the older world.  This tome is where the record of all things is kept."
NAMA_RENAME_SPEECH3_TEXT_SID=Nama pauses.  "Names are such fluid things.  If you are unhappy with yours, I would be happy to record your new name."
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_SID=Rename?
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_NEW_NAME_SID=Enter your new name: 
NAMA_RENAME_QUERY_AFFIRM_SID="Splendid!" exclaims Nama, writing your new name with a flourish of his quill.

IDEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Idem
IDEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Idem
IDEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Dressed in hard leather armour, wrapped in a cloak of many-furs, Idem has the appearance of a true adventurer.  While obviously elven, he is quite large and stocky, looking almost closer to human.  His age is betrayed by the short brown hair that has started to grey, and the pronounced crow's feet around his eyes.  Underneath the cloak of furs, his armour shows signs of etchings: ravens, and boars' heads, and other ancient things.  An iron hammer hangs from his waist.  He wears a small backpack that appears ready to burst, crammed with all manner of wands, scrolls, and other rediscovered things.
IDEM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Idem says, "I'm a bit short on ivory for my trip home.  If you have anything you need identified, perhaps we could work something out."
IDEM_NOT_ENOUGH_IVORY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID="I'd need more ivory than you're carrying to tell you about that!"

LAYPERSON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=layperson
LAYPERSON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a layperson
LAYPERSON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the nine, those who are members of a church or temple, but not formal members of the religious organization, are termed the laity.  These people are responsible for day-to-day operations of the churches and temples and their services.  This can include sweeping the floors, acting as an usher or acolyte during a service, or any number of other tasks.  Laypeople outnumber the clergy by a large number, and fill an important role in the religious community.  It has often been noted that without the clergy, there would be no church, but without the laity, the church could not function.
LAYPERSON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The layperson says, "Mind the braziers."
DEVOTEE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=devotee
DEVOTEE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a devotee
DEVOTEE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Part of the everyday throng of parishioners and temple-goers, devotees are particularly strong in their faith.  They attend services regularly, tithe a portion of their income, and attempt to live out the tenets of their deity in their everyday life.  Their faith gives them a staff to lean on in tough times, and an escutcheon against the whispers of monsters and demons.
DEVOTEE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The devotee says, "Praise be!"
FOLLOWER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=follower
FOLLOWER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a follower
FOLLOWER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Followers attend services largely because it is expected, because in every community there exist certain expectations with regards to religion.  They go because their neighbours go, and because if they do not, their neighbours will talk.  So once or twice a week, followers put on slightly nicer clothes, and spend an hour or two listening to the clerics preach their teachings.  And after, they go home, change, and get on with the rest of their lives.
FOLLOWER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The follower nods hello.
APOSTLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apostle
APOSTLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apostle
APOSTLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The power of the Nine's religious followings is focused in the central lands.  To spread the word out to the far reaches, the churches and temples use apostles.  These men and women are deeply devoted, and travel sometimes for years to reach remote villages and camps.  They set up small worship sites out of whatever is at hand: logs, sod, rough stone.  And once this is done, they preach their religious teachings, and send regular missives back home.  
APOSTLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apostle regards you warmly.
PILGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=pilgrim
PILGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There are many important religious sites throughout the world, and pilgrims travel to these out of sense both of devotion and adventure.  How else to describe sailing many thousands of miles to visit the bones of a saint brought down in a hail of arrows, or the first tiny stone church built for the skraelings of the north?  Pilgrims spend a life on the road, travelling from place to place, carried only by their faith and the sense that there is always something new to see, something that will, for a moment, bring them ever closer to the Nine.
PILGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pilgrim
PILGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The pilgrim greets you with a weary voice.
YOUNG_WOMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=young woman
YOUNG_WOMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a young woman
YOUNG_WOMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in a bonnet and dress, the young woman has not yet been married off to an appropriate suitor.  For a short time, her life is hers to enjoy, until her family finds her a suitable man.  For once they have children, the rest of her life is essentially set.  Her days will be full of domestic tasks and chores, caring for the children, cleaning their home.  Once the children grow up, if they survive the ravages of disease and chance, then her remaining years are dwindling and few, each glance at the mirror an unspoken question: where has the time gone?  And where have I gone with it?
YOUNG_WOMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The young woman smiles at you sweetly.
TRADESMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tradesman
TRADESMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tradesman
TRADESMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tradesmen include carpenters and joiners, stonemasons, tilelayers, and bakers.  They count among themselves the members of any skilled trade, and tradesmen typically spend their lives mastering a particular craft.  They are an essential part of any village or town, and occupy a place on the social scale above unskilled manual workers, but below the shopkeepers and merchants.
TRADESMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tradesman tips his cap.
MERCHANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=merchant
MERCHANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a merchant
MERCHANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Merchants facilitate the flow of goods to and fro, whether by arranging the shipping of tons of rugs and spices, or simply driving a wagon of small wares down a country road.  By and large, merchants tend to be well off.  By making a small profit on each item sold, merchants are able to afford good housing, plenty of food, and often are able to hire protection for journeys that would otherwise be ill-considered in the face of pirates, bandits, and monsters.
MERCHANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The merchant flashes a gold-toothed smile.
TRAVELLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=traveller
TRAVELLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a traveller
TRAVELLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=For some people, wanderlust is not just a word, but a real, driving feeling.  They feel the distance calling, that somewhere down the road is surely better than here.  Those travellers, wanderers, wayfarers - however they prefer to be called - carry their lives on their back, moving from place to place, never staying long.  Their possessions are typically meagre: a bedroll, some food and a waterskin, a walking stick, a knife.  But they are enough to support them as they wander from town to town, or as they live off the land in spring and summer.
TRAVELLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The traveller nods at you wearily.
GUARDSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=guardsman
GUARDSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a guardsman
GUARDSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Every village has at least a few guardsmen, men and women tasked with tasked with defending the village from the many threats beyond the borders.  And there are many: goblin raiders roam the seas, bandits walk the roadways, and there have been more and more reports of strange, ancient monsters.  Guardsmen tend to be lightly armed and armoured with whatever is at hard.  Scraps of armour, ill-fitting helmets, and rickety spears are all common, as are varying levels of skill and bravery.
GUARDSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The guardsman salutes you with his spear.
WATCH_CAPTAIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=watch captain
WATCH_CAPTAIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a watch captain
WATCH_CAPTAIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=In each village, the watch generally consists of peasant farmers, merchants, and others who can barely hold a spear.  But commanding them are hard men: former soldiers and bodyguards, even some mercenaries, who wear real armour and carry keen, well-forged swords.  The watch captains ensure the safety of the village, acting as leaders and commanders.  They organize the archers, spearmen, and guardsmen, and then act as the final layer of defense against the dark things of the world.
WATCH_CAPTAIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The watch captain hails you.
SPEARMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spearman
SPEARMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spearman
SPEARMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lowest member of the infantry, the spearman nonetheless plays an essential role in any watch or military organization.  Spears require little in the way of training, and are remarkably cheap to make, requiring comparatively much fewer resources than a sword or even an axe.  Despite this, spears remain remarkably effective weapons, turning even the simplest peasant into a deadly foe.  For the lowest classes, the spears may be little more than sharpened sticks, while soldiers may have sturdy, well-balanced spears, suitable for throwing or close combat.
SPEARMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spearman twirls his spear at you.
ARCHER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=archer
ARCHER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an archer
ARCHER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skilled at ranged combat, archers can be armed with anything from simple rocks, to slings and spears, or bows and crossbows.  Lightly armoured, they typically wear simple clothing or some sort of uniform and carry only a knife or club for close-quarters combat.  Preferring to fight from a distance, they strike their opponents relentlessly from a distance, weakening or killing them before letting the spearmen or cavalry do their work.  Archers tend to have much more training than simple infantry, as the aim and focus required is something cultivated over a lifetime.
ARCHER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The archer cocks an eyebrow.
HILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hild
HILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hild
HILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While the ploughman may feed us all, the weaver is just as important, weaving clothes from base fibres, knitting scarves and gloves from sheep's wool, practicing an ancient and largely thankless trade.  In Isen Dun, Hild is that weaver.  A woman of middle age, she wears tidy, well-made clothing, and pins her hair up tightly.  Her wheel and loom are aged, but well-maintained, and candlelight can often be seen from her hut as she works late into the night, weaving cloaks, clothes, and robes.
HILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hild says, "You'll need some practice and a fibre like whiteflower puff if you want to operate the wheel and loom."
TANNER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=tanner
TANNER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tanner
TANNER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The treating of hides with tannins is the most basic way to create leather.  The process is dirty, smelly, and generally dangerous, causing wasting diseases later in life due to prolonged exposure to the tannins.  Despite the lower status of the trade, tanners are well-valued by the communities in which they live.  They provide leather for clothing, for tents, for armour - the durability of leather makes it suitable for many things.  Tanners themselves tend to be practical, down-to-earth types.  They toil long hours for little pay, but are aware of their worth: along with the smith, the community's tanner provides the basic equipment a community needs to deal with the ever-present threat of raiders and monsters.
TANNER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The tanner says, "Skins can become many things: a fine cap, a soldier's cuirass, a sturdy pair of boots, or a cloak to keep out the weather."
HRIMGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of the Isenlings, Hrimgar is a tall, regal man.  Just a shade under forty, his hair and beard have begun to grey; but despite this, he still looks strong and powerful, and is said to still lead the charge of his people into battle.
HRIMGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hrimgar says, "You are welcome in our lands, traveller."
SIRIATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Siriath
SIRIATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=Siriath
SIRIATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Taking up residence in the dungeons south-east of Isen Dun, Siriath works by torch-light, delving into black and unspeakable things.  An elderly man in the twilight of his life, his skin is thin and papery, his hair waist-length.  His eyes are blue and startling, beautiful and full of hate.  Walking with aid of his staff, he nonetheless seems to draw his strength from some otherworldly resevoir, working day and night without sleeping, desperately trying to grasp greater truths before his years come to an end.
SIRIATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Siriath screams at you, his voice full of rage and hate.
GARROS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ugly, scarred man, Garros is missing an eye, an ear, and several teeth.  The remnants of a ratty cape hang from his shoulders, closed by a cheap wooden clasp, and his boots look ill-fitting.  But at his waist you can see a large, stone hammer, its curved head filthy and caked with blood.
GARROS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Garros cackles, "How appropriate that you shall perish here!  Your life shall a-mound to nothing!"
HOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hound
HOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hound
HOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large dog descended at some point from wolves, the hound is easily trained by men for guarding, work, or even just companionship.  Hounds are smaller than their wolven brethren, and less muscular, but they can still be ferocious when provoked.
HOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hound growls.
WHITE_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The white wolf is a larger cousin of the common wolf.  Typically found in colder climates, its silvery-white fur provides natural camouflage in the snow-covered arctic tundras and boreal forests.  Despite the size of the species, the white wolf possesses a high-pitched howl, closer in timbre to a coyote's.  They typically feed on mammals such as deer, foxes, and rabbits, but in times of hunger, they have been known to attack camps and settlements.
WHITE_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The white wolf growls.
CYCLOPS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cyclops
CYCLOPS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cyclops
CYCLOPS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient race of giants, the cyclopes tower over the tallest giants and ogres.  The cyclops is distinguished by a single eye in the middle of its forehead.  Typically at least sixty feet tall, they dress in patchwork skins sewn from elephant and rhino hides.  They are quick to anger.  Cyclopes carry clubs fashioned from the trunks of huge trees, the ends studded with spikes of mammoth tusks.  They live deep in the highest mountain ranges, gathering in small clans to build stone dwellings and live their lives far from the rest of the world.
CYCLOPS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cyclops thunders, "I shall destroy you!"
CHIMERA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chimera
CHIMERA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chimera
CHIMERA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chimeras are the monstrous fusion of a goat's body, a lion's head, and a serpent tail.  Agents of pure chaos and destruction, they breathe fire, attacking anything in their way.  While they were originally thought to be the recent creation of Sceadugenga, a number of bronze statues from long-lost civilizations have been unearthed, suggesting these creatures terrorized the civilized world as far back as recorded time.
CHIMERA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chimera hisses, bleats, and roars.
WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyrm
WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyrm
WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though the modern "worm" derives from the ancient "wyrm", it does its ancestor no justice.  Wyrms are massive, fire-breathing serpents that live deep beneath the earth: in caverns, mines, and any other passage large enough to house their massive forms.  They have a deep love of gold.  Greedy and hungry, they lie coiled on their great hoards, aware of each coin, each goblet and gem.  Their anger is immense, and when they roar, the very earth trembles.
WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyrm opens its great jaws to the sky, and breathes a terrible flame high into the air.
THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thief
THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thief
THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Disliked everywhere and trusted nowhere, the thief lives outside of society, taking what he can, and by force if necessary.  Many work alone, but in the larger central cities, they have been known to form guilds, forging a common bond and language.  They are despised by those who do honest work, who see them as uncouth at best, and murderous at worst.  This is not entirely incorrect.
THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thief scowls, "I'll spill your guts, then take the coins from your eyes!"
APPRENTICE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apprentice
APPRENTICE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apprentice
APPRENTICE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Apprentices study the arcane arts under practicing wizards.  As with acolytes and their holy path, apprentices leave their homes at a young age to work under established wizards, where they learn to read Old Runic, prepare herbs and distillations, and acquiring other prerequisites to the magical arts.  Their days are spent in service, assisting their master, while their nights are spent reading ancient texts, mastering the language and linguistics of the old magics.  After a number of years, once their study is deemed satisfactory, they receive their wizard's staff.  Each will say, though, that the staff is truly only the beginning of their study.
APPRENTICE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apprentice murmurs, "All men pass to dust, but what we study in life defines us."
THAUMATURGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thaumaturge
THAUMATURGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thaumaturge
THAUMATURGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Somewhere between witchlings and priests lies the thaumaturge, possessors of magical powers they consider gifted and controlled by the Nine.  Combining holy devotion with these innate magical skills, thaumaturges are able to fuse the mortal and the divine to create great magical acts.  They are often seen as miracle-workers, but it is this same ability that fuels a distrust among the common folk, and as a result, thaumaturges rarely stay in one place for long.  Forced to wander, thaumaturges exist at the edge of the civilized world, pushed back by fears and superstitions they can never understand.
THAUMATURGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thaumaturge says, "The world is full of wonders we have yet to understand."
SQUIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=squire
SQUIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a squire
SQUIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To become a knight, one must possess the correct personal or family status, but that is not sufficient, itself.  One must undergo a number of years of training, learning under the watchful eye of a knight, before being granted knighthood.  Those that attend to and fight under a knight are squires.  Typically the sons of nobility, squires learn to read and write, to fight with the sword and lance, and the correct way in which to carry themselves.  Only once they have done this, and proven their mettle in battle, are they granted the title of knighthood, with all the privileges it entails.
SQUIRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The squire looks at you boldly.
GAS_CLOUD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gas cloud
GAS_CLOUD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gas cloud
GAS_CLOUD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Bright yellow-green clouds that roil and rumble, gas clouds are said to be the hateful spirits of the recently dead.  Those whose circumstances prevent them from passing peacefully into the world beyond often find themselves trapped, their mindless spirits pinned to the physical world.  And for those troubled souls who did not go gently, their discontent coalesces in the air.  It reacts with stray and unstable gases, binding them together - for a time.  For it is said that when the spirit is finally released, the result is an explosive reaction of hate and fire.
GRAVEROBBER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=As the thief is to the honest occupations, so is the graverobber to thieves.  Possessing none of the respect for the dead (and many of their possessions), the graverobber makes his wealth off the death of others, disinterring the dead for their weapons, ivory, and gold.
GRAVEROBBER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The graverobber laughs, "You know what I love best about my job? The dead can't protest!"
BLACKGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackguard
BLACKGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackguard
BLACKGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Blackguards are known by many other names: mercenary, sellsword, brigand, outlaw.  Usually possessing only a simple sword and the clothes on their back, they rely on their wits and skill in combat to make a living, fighting in armies in other peoples' wars, or simply waylaying strangers on back roads.
BLACKGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A blackguard spits, "You worthless cur! I'll cut you down where you stand!"
GIANT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant
GIANT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant
GIANT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Giants are ancient creatures, who warred with the faerie folk in the first age of the world.  But their descendents found themselves feared and shunned by the races that followed, and now live a marginalized existence, gathering in small villages and huddling together for protection.  For though a giant is a formiddable opponent, the other races found that the giants' great strength could be countered by use of a large number of scattered archers.  Consequently, large numbers were hunted or driven away, and the few that remain are wary of the words of outsiders.
GIANT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant bellows, "Fee Fi Fo Fum!"
GIANT_STONETOSSER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant stonetosser
GIANT_STONETOSSER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant stonetosser
GIANT_STONETOSSER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though the giants who practice ranged combat by tossing massive boulders are often referred to as stonetossers, it really does them little justice.  The boulders they throw, with a strength that makes it look easy, can be the size of a warhorse or larger, unliftable by ten men.  These giants are deeply feared, and legends are told of a cavalry rush in ages past that met a spectacular end when a giant stonetosser rolled a massive boulder through the charging horsemen.
GIANT_STONETOSSER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant roars.
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant earthshaker
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant earthshaker
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=All giants are dangerous foes, but their elite fighters are the earthshakers.  They wear armour made of massive stone plates, strung together with corded steel, and wield two-handed clubs the size of two large men.  Though slowed by their immense armour, they make up for it with a tremendous strength that they can use to destroy stone walls, portcullises, and other elements of fortifications.  Men who find themselves at the receiving end of a blow from a giant earthshaker rarely live, and even then, are rarely recognizable.
GIANT_EARTHSHAKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ground thunders as the giant earthshaker approaches.
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant griffinrider
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant griffinrider
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though horses are the preferred mount for human and elven cavalry, there is no horse alive large enough for a giant.  And so, many thousands of years ago, the first griffin was domesticated by a giant, and taught to allow a rider.  Since then, giants have bred and trained griffins for combat.  There is little more terrifying to an army than looking up to see a griffin descending, talons outstretched, while the armour giant upon it readies its massive club.
GIANT_GRIFFINRIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The griffin shrieks and groans under the load.
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=giant cloudwalker
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a giant cloudwalker
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The average giant stands three times the height of a man.  But sometimes, an exceptionally tall giant is born.  These giants, known as cloudwalkers by the other races, stand the height of six men.  Their ability in combat is terrifying, as their massive strength allows them to tear through plate armour bare-handed, crush skulls like eggs, and smash through walls single-handedly.  Cloudwalkers often become chiefs, with the other giants deferrential to their mighty strength and terrifying tempers.
GIANT_CLOUDWALKER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The giant cloudwalker laughs raucously.
WEEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=weeper
WEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a weeper
WEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Told of in fireside tales, weepers are mentioned in low voices, lest they be summoned by their name.  It is said that they are heard before they are seen, their unearthly presence announced by the soft sound of weeping.  The sobbing is low, piteous, and incessant; it is said that once the sobbing is heard, the one hearing it will hear nothing else for days.  Unable to rest, unable to take any pleasure in food or drink, the victim slowly begins to hallucinate, and finally go mad.  It is at this point that the weeper appears, always a young girl or child, dressed in dirty rags, her empty eyes white and bleeding, her final touch colder than death.
WEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The weeper sobs quietly.
OGRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre
OGRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre
OGRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogres are huge and thickly-built, with the strength of many men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures’ fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.  Ogres make up for this with a tremendous strength and fortitude.  They are often seen wearing scraps of armour plundered from their kills, and often carry some sort of clubs, some even wielding the trunks of small trees.
OGRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre snarls, "I'll grind your bones to make my bread!"
OGRE_HURLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre hurler
OGRE_HURLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre hurler
OGRE_HURLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=While elves are known for their accuracy with bow and arrow, and dwarves with crossbow and bolt, ogres prefer to simply toss trees at those they dislike.  Fashioning crude missiles from large sections of tree trunks, they hurl these cabers with ferocious strength and speed.  While these may lack the accuracy of an elven longbow, they make up for this in the sheer destructive power created on impact: breaking bones, crushing spines, the cabers take a terrible toll.
OGRE_HURLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre hurler growls at you, and flexes its enormous arms.
OGRE_SAVAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Evil and cruel, even for ogres, ogre savages wear their fallen foes.  They wear necklaces made from their victims' skulls.  The skins are tanned and made into clothing, and their clubs are spiked with bones.  Ogre savages tend to wear little armour, preferring to fortify themselves with strange potions brewed by their shamans.
OGRE_SAVAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre savage roars, "I'll add your skull to my necklace!"
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre bonegrinder
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre bonegrinder
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=So called for their habit of grinding the bones of their dead opponents to sprinkle into their firewater, ogre bonegrinders are ruthless, efficient warriors.  Unlike most ogres, their skill in combat and social standing means that they have had specially-made armour, typically loose steel plates over leather.  Their bodies are covered in scars - some given by the dead, others self-inflicted, for bonegrinders believe that they must not exit combat without having bled in some capacity.
OGRE_BONEGRINDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre bonegrinder looks at you and licks its lips.
OGRE_MAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre mage
OGRE_MAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre mage
OGRE_MAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogre magi share some similarities with sages, who through careful study are able to cast all kinds of spells.  But though sages acquire their knowledge through decades of work, ogre magi are far more crude, passing their knowledge down from one mage to the other by means of a strange alphabet only they can understand.  The high wizards scorn these learnings, considering them laughably primitive, but it is undeniable that ogre magi can both conjure the elements, and see glimpses of events in the far past and future.
OGRE_MAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre mage's green, cat-like eyes glitter from beneath its cowl.
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre war captain
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre war captain
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When ogres go to war, the bands are led by fearsome war captains, ogres who through years of brutal killing have risen to the top of their hierarchy.  Unlike most other ogres, who prefer heavy, blunt objects, the war captains prefer massive great swords, which allow them to tear through the things in front of them.
OGRE_WAR_CAPTAIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre war captain draws his sword and aims it towards you.
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre annihilator
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre annihilator
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wearing black-steel armour, armed with great swords or vicious halberds, ogres annihilators are masters of calculated savagery.  Having studied with the magi and fought as brothers with the war captains, they fight with the combination of this experience.  Their weapons are infused with magical might, their armour protected with ancient wards.  And they fight with a cunning and strength that overmatches all but the mightiest foes.
OGRE_ANNIHILATOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre annihilator releases a primal scream.
URGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Armoured in scraps of plate, carrying a huge, spiked club, Urgrim is an imposing presence.  His eyes burn beneath the visor of a plundered helm, beady and small, full of hate.  Leader of his band, he arrived at his authority through ruthlessness, slaughtering the previous chief in full view of his tribe and daring any to try the same with him.
URGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Urgrim spits, "I'll hang your flayed skin on the walls of my camp!"
SKAAL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Skaal
SKAAL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Skaal
SKAAL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of Stoneheim, Skaal Greybeard has ruled the Great Hall of the Mountains since boyhood.  "The boy-chief", as he was known, ascended to the granite throne when his father and grandfather were slain in battle, falling to the goblin hordes.  Skaal grew up quickly, mediating disputes, learning history and politics, and training in the battleaxe.  His sound judgement have made him popular with his people, and he is regarded as proud and fair by those leaders who have dealt with him.
SKAAL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Skaal says, "Hail, adventurer, and welcome to Stoneheim."
GILDI_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gildi
GILDI_DESCRIPTION_SID=Gildi
GILDI_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An elderly dwarf, white-beard and hunched by age, Gildi wears a long black robe that flows behind him, bobbing gently as he walks.  He has a soft voice, firm but friendly; his movements are slow but meaningful.  It is said that Gildi is a sage of uncertain age.  Certainly he has lived in Stoneheim his entire life, bartering books and manuscripts from passing sailors, his days and nights spent in constant study.  During the last goblin incursion, the dwarves swear that Gildi rained fire from the heavens on the coming ships, and for his part, Gildi has never denied this.  He is content to live out his days in the mountain halls, acting as healer and wizard, and helping the priest to tend the church.
GILDI_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Gildi nods at you.  "I can tell you've come this way for something."
THENGIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thengil
THENGIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=Thengil
THENGIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The smith of Stoneheim, Thengil cuts an imposing figure.  His hair and beard flow down past his waist, both braided and coal-black.  His skin is dark, too, marking him as a black dwarf, an offshoot of dwarvenkind who came to the surface years ago and adapted physically to a blazing hot climate.  Thengil operates the heavy forges, crafting weapons and armour for the dwarves of the mountain.  Exceptionally skilled at his craft, his weapons are sought far beyond the dwarven kingdom, beloved by adventurers and mercenaries for the perfection of their balance and heft.
THENGIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Thengil nods at you, his face blackened by his forge.
TINDR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tindr
TINDR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Tindr
TINDR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A short, lean dwarf, Tindr is one of the few who regularly leaves the comfort and protection of the mountains to venture into the world beyond.  Still a youth by dwarven standards, he keeps his face close-shaved, and his hair shaggy.  He travels light, carrying only a backpack with some food and clothes, and a thin dwarven dagger at his waist.  His eyes are bright and inquisitive, and his face seems to be fixed permenantly with an irreverent grin.
TINDR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Tindr grins.  "Gildi and Thengil are incredibly gifted - imagine what they could make together!"
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dwarven bodyguard
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dwarven bodyguard
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=After Skaal ascended as a young child to become leader of Stoneheim, he found that leaders and diplomats did not take him seriously, hiding smirks and grins as they talked with the boy-chief.  As a remedy, Skaal formed an elite band of bodyguards to stand by him and protect him.  Over the course of his life, this group has encompassed an elite group of warriors held in high esteem by the people of the mountain.  The bodyguards all wear heavy plate armour, their faces obscured by heavy helmets; only their long, braided hair is visible.  They each carry massive stone hammers, and stand, immobile, while their leader conducts his affairs.
DWARVEN_BODYGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dwarven bodyguard grunts.
PIERCING_EYE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=piercing eye
PIERCING_EYE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a piercing eye
PIERCING_EYE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A fiendish creature born of fire and magic, piercing eyes lurk in ruins and dungeons, deep in forests and far beneath the earth.  A burning, unblinking sphere in the shape of a massive eye, the piercing eye's flames cut through the strongest steel, searing the flesh beneath.  They have long been used by dungeon keepers as guardians for precious things, sent to lurk deep in the darkness before revealing themselves in an eruption of searing flame.
PIERCING_EYE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=You are transfixed by the piercing eye's burning gaze.
DEEP_CRAWLER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=deep crawler
DEEP_CRAWLER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a deep crawler
DEEP_CRAWLER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Massive, centipede-like creatures, deep crawlers are terrifyingly quick insects that possess a potent venom.  They are typically found far beneath the world's surface, but occasionally make their way to the surface and into the fields and forests.  Due to their enormous size, they are greatly feared, and hunted down as soon as they are seen - perhaps for this reason they are known to be much more common in caves and caverns.
DEEP_CRAWLER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The deep crawler clicks its mandibles in anticipation.
STONE_GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=stone golem
STONE_GOLEM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a stone golem
STONE_GOLEM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When making a golem, the traditional material is clay.  The pliability of clay allows the artificer to mold it into the rough shape of a man easily.  But for the more determined artificer, stone offers the possibility of an immensely strong golem - if the artificer can find a way to carve it.  Stone golems lumber about slowly, but are immensely strong, their thick, stone bodies augmented by the strong magics that bind them.
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=animated armour
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an animated armour
ANIMATED_ARMOUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thought by some to be spirits inhabiting the mail of the dead, the creatures known as animated armours are actually constructs of the same family as the golem.  Working in tandem with a skilled smith, the artificer imbues the armour with powerful magic, allowing it to move, and attack.  Often armed with a halberd or long spear, these creations are often sent to guard something valuable, attacking mindlessly until the armour itself is damaged, releasing the magic and falling to pieces.
IRON_HORROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=iron horror
IRON_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=an iron horror
IRON_HORROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Terrifying, flying creatures formed of molten iron, iron horrors blaze with an intense red-white glow.  Only documented recently, it is thought that they exist only at the center of the world, discovered when the gnomes and dwarves dug too deep.  Lacking the features of the overworld races - such as a fixed form - they speak not with mouths but telepathically, their strange language appearing unbidden in the mind.  And when they attack, they are utterly ferocious, destroying skin and bone with molten iron, leaving little more than a destroyed husk behind.
IRON_HORROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A voice appears in your mind, the words some sort of speech from beyond the stars.
HOLY_SHADE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=holy shade
HOLY_SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a holy shade
HOLY_SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most holy men and women die, the bodies are buried or burned, the spirits ascending to the heavens to live with the Nine.  But the Nine have their unknowable ways, and some holy servants find their spirits bound to the earth, their service continuing into the next life.  These holy shades are granted great powers, able to bring divine wrath against the unholy and unbelieving, their spirit forms glowing with holy light.  These shades are often found near holy sites such as temples and churches, but many stalk the world elsewhere, their divine mission eternal and unknown.
HOLY_SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The holy shade opens its mouth, and you are greeted by a screeching rasp.
DIVINE_AVENGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=divine avenger
DIVINE_AVENGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a divine avenger
DIVINE_AVENGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shapeshifting, divine beings in service of the Nine, divine avengers appear as great, upright beasts or angelic creatures, wielding massive, holy blades.  Granted great speed by their deity, they are able to overwhelm all but the most powerful of creatures.  Records of divine avengers are rare; it is known that in the earliest recorded histories, some blessed armies were led with one at the fore, tearing through spearmen and bowman, cleaving armour and shield.  But since then, there have been few recorded sightings, and it is believed that this is because there have been no survivors to tell the tale.
DIVINE_AVENGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The divine avenger shimmers and shifts.
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=temple guardian
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a temple guardian
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Divine beings towering over giants and trolls and even titans, temple guardians are night-invincible, protected by almost a foot of steel.  They wield massive-two handed hammers, the heads of which are covered with spikes and runes.  Temple guardians are tasked by the Nine with guarding their most important churches, temples, and sites of death, a task which these unspeaking, eternal beings perform ceaselessly.
TEMPLE_GUARDIAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The temple guardian's expression is indiscernible beneath its visor.
LICH_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lich king
LICH_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lich king
LICH_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=One of the most dangerous and terrifying of the corporeal undead, the lich king is the unholy and animated remnants of a great sorceror.  Granted life eternal by black magic, these creatures remain trapped in a state between death and life: able to see without eyes, move without muscles.  Mostly skeletal, but with bits of flesh hanging off the bones, lich kings wear tattered clothing and robes, their skeletal hands clutching gnarled wooden staves that glow in unearthly light.  Wielding deep magics against the living, it is said that their touch can poison, slow, even petrify their victims, and it is for this reason that lich kings are deeply feared.
LICH_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lich king hisses, "Hwaet! Yrthling, saecild, nu lifgreota!"
HOLLOW_MAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hollow man
HOLLOW_MAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hollow man
HOLLOW_MAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Festering undead, hollow men are corpses bound together by powerful magic.  Their skeletons and organs rotted long ago, they are filled with vile, venomous insects.  The touch of a hollow man is intensely acidic, eating at armour and weapons, disfiguring the skin beneath.  Like most undead, they are speechless, but those who have tried have been greeted by swarms of flies, wasps, and scarabs escaping from within.
HOLLOW_MAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hollow man opens his putrid mouth, releasing a cloud of insects.

TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Here - I found this deep in our archives.  Appropriately, it's Kellurian.  I have no clue what it does, but it must be important to survive so long."
TWILLE_BOOK_QUEST_COMPLETE3_SID="A deal's a deal.  It's yours.  I wouldn't know what to do with it, anyway."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START_SID=Kew looks you over. "I know your kind.  Eager for treasure and fame, keen to hone your name and have it ring through the ages."
KEW_DUNGEON_QUEST_START2_SID="Perhaps we can arrange a deal.  There is a dungeon to the south-east.  I used to explore it in my youth, those days long since gone."

HILD_WEAVING_QUEST_START2_SID=She looks sadly at her loom. "My supply of whiteflower is dwindling.  I could get more, but it's become dangerous."

HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_START2_SID="I have heard of a horrifying creature lurking in the caves and caverns: a monstrous wyrm born of chaos, who grows more powerful by the day."
HRIMGAR_WYRM_QUEST_START3_SID="It would be too much to ask such an undertaking, but if you slay the wyrm, your deeds shall live on in song, your name forever spoken."

PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_START_SID=The ploughman says, "Harvest has been good this year, as ever, thanks to me. But the rare herbs I am trying to grow require so much light."
PLOUGHMAN_SUNGEM_QUEST_START2_SID="Graverobbers have opened Wulf's burial ship, but it is not all bad: I have heard he was buried with a celestial stone, the sun gem."

CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_START2_SID="Beneath lies a ship, that of Wulf, our first king.  Within it lies his earthly wealth: ivory, of course, but also gems and jewels."

CYNWISE_SUNGEM_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Cynwise's eyes light up.  "The Sun Gem!  It is just as beautiful as I'd heard!  Thank you, adventurer!  I will keep it safe."

CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START_SID="Years ago, some families left to found a new village," Cynwise tells you. "This village was Aeschburh, and lies north-west of here."
CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START2_SID="It was sacked by raiders decades ago.  But now there are lights, visible at night.  My crows tell of digging, and bones.  Something is foul there."
CYNWISE_AESCHBURH_QUEST_START3_SID="The bones are being sent on a black tide somewhere else.  The diggers and their leader bear the black mark, marking them servants of Sceaudgenga."

EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_START_SID=The exile pauses, then speaks. "I was happy, once. Ruler and ring-giver, my people's protector. I was said to be just and strong; a good king."
EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_START2_SID="Then, one night, torches: raiders, spear-men from across the sea-lanes. We fought well - I cut down many men with my greatsword."
EXILE_SISTER_QUEST_START3_SID="Oswald, my chancellor, found boats. My sister and I were cast off like driftwood into the cold sea. I drifted south; she, far to the west."

CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_START3_SID="He talked of sweet music, the music of beasts, led by a man-lion, a black manticore. Slay it, and you will be richly rewarded."
CHRISTOF_MINE_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Christof smiles.  "Thank you, adventurer.  We will be able to bury our dead, and mine our gems once more.  You have our thanks."

LALOS_GROTTO_QUEST_START_SID="We are a proud people, and clever," murmurs Ilru. "Among our most clever is Lalo, and strong too - as skilled with spells as the spear."
LALOS_GROTTO_QUEST_START2_SID="But he delved too deep, and was driven mad by magic.  One night last month he left suddenly.  Soon after, the sea was thick with corpses."
LALOS_GROTTO_QUEST_START3_SID="The currents carry them to Lalo's grotto, where he reanimates them with vile magic.  He is beyond hope - slay him, and expel his black magic!"

KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_START2_SID="It is an ancient monastery. They foul it with their presence, with their worship of the Black Ogre; from there, they plot the sack of Atua-Elar."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_START3_SID="They watch for us, but not for you.  Take this hammer - it is Goblincrusher, an ancient relic.  Kill their captain and they will surely scatter."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="They were a powerful party," says Kirin, "But not as strong as you.  We thank you, and wish you good winds for your travels."
KIRIN_GOBLIN_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="Recently, we excavated an ancient chamber in our ossuary, unmarked for millenia.  We found this mail, silver and gleaming."

THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_START_SID=Thengil grunts.  "Gildi tells me of bits of legend about a fiery star that crashed into the world before the dwarves, before the elves."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_START2_SID="He said that at the centre of that were two things: some kind of abomination, and a small stone, the hardened core of a dead star."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_START3_SID="Bring me that cosmos stone, and I will forge you the greatest sword the world has ever seen."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Thengil looks over the Cosmos Stone.  "This is it?  It doesn't look like much.  If we're being honest, I think you might be cheating me."
THENGIL_COSMOS_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID=As you pass the stone, his eyes widen.  "It's so heavy for such a tiny thing!  What metals must be found within!"

SKAAL_WYRMESWRAEC_QUEST_COMPLETE2_SID="If you follow it, you will need protection.  Take this shield - Thengil's finest, and a ward against dragonfire."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START_SID="In myth," recalls the caravan master, "the faerie folk lived in their underground hall, Cithriel, laughing and feasting."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START2_SID="Cithriel is no myth, though empty since the faerie folk left this world, everything left just so in memory of our ancestors."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START3_SID="But recently, a menace: demons from the black plains, horrors from the cosmos, led and bound by five black-marked summoners."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CITHRIEL_QUEST_START4_SID="Destroy them!" bellows the caravan master.  "Slay those hateful wizards, and let Cithriel fade from the memory of man."

CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START2_SID="You have heard of Elfenwael?  Our black day?  The giants met us in battle, and scattered our people - this much is known."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START3_SID="Less known is how: four brothers entered the Underworld, and sold their souls, gaining great powers in exchange for walking the world above."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START4_SID="Weyg, Rhone, Carne, and Phole - their names are known to us, and cursed.  They guard the mouth of the underworld, the lake known as the Caldera."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START5_SID="It is in the dwarf lands, in the far north-west.  They guard the entrance, a dark, murky lake shrouded by fog, surrounded by rock and shale."
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_START6_SID="My people are gone now.  We are their pale, thin shadow.  But you can avenge them, adventurer.  Slay the giants!  Cast them to the world below!"
CARAVAN_MASTER_CALDERA_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID="Adventurer, thank you.  History will not record this victory, but your name will be spoken by us, forever and ever."

ALTUS_QUEST_START3_SID="You can find them in Sithrin.  Take the stone, then climb the tower and destroy Zaeda.  His magics are dark and bode ill for this world."
ALTUS_QUEST_COMPLETE_SID=Altus shivers, looking pale and frail.  "It is so?  Zaeda is no more?  Then truly you must be the sort of hero this world needs."

ALTUS_QUEST_TITLE_SID=Zaeda's Tower
