Me:
- Implement fletchery.
- Allow hungerless races to gain health over time, just very, very
  slowly.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- Creatures should have a chance to follow up/down stairs with special
  case for returning to overworld.  Chance should be based on hostility
  and an Escape roll.  Update Guidebook.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  are 2.
- Creatures should be smarter about the use of spells given that creatures
  will fight back and summon help.
- Arcane damage should destroy wands, rings, potions, scrolls, texts,
  some of the time (30%).  There should be a 10% chance of actually
  enchanting the item, though.  Try to limit to "magic only".
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- Travelling bazaars.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Telari, the Drowned Isle
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Guilds and membership, mutual exclusivity, etc.
- In-game gambling: arena fights, games of chance, etc.
- LOS reduction at night-time, can be negated by skill in Blindfighting.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Add splitting behaviour to all jellies: when hit, they have some
  chance (10-20%?) of splitting.  Each creature in the split has half
  the current HP of the original.
- Recall spell that takes you back to the overworld.
- Armour flags

Anon: 
- Look into resists and crits - had Heat -0.05, got one-shot by Eakauri
- Character dumps while blinded show all items as "something"

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

Legend:
- Option to always prompt on stack pickup

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

- Praying removes the Disfiguration status, but does not remove the stat 
  malus instantly; it goes away eventually, though. I have been unable to 
  test other status effects because of how rarely they occur
- At Archery 70 and above, projectiles will rarely hit, except at 
  point-blank range. There's not even a message about missing. Everything 
  else goes as usual, though, the ammo disappears from your inventory, the 
  attack animation is carried out, and it goes to the right place, it just 
  fails to produce any message, about hitting or otherwise. Higher values 
  of Archery fail to hit/produce a message more often; at Archery 100, it 
  is impossible to hit anyone unless they are literally beside you- or at 
  least, it's very unlikely.
- Figured out the issue with the crypt-keys; they stack with other crypt 
  keys that you might be carrying, which I suppose breaks the connection 
  it's supposed to have with the lock.
- The 'searing light' traps can't be disarmed, even at Disarm Traps 100. 
  Presumably because it doesn't break down into items like fire traps or 
  poison traps?
- The speed of using the Thievery skill doesn't seem to scale with speed 
  (e.g. like moving one space or making an attack does).
- Divine avengers sent by an angry god can spawn friendly if you're 
  charismatic enough.
- A god's divine lightning stops regeneration of HP and AP, permanently.

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies have a tendency to hit all their friends with 
  spells and get smashed even without your intervention. If their friends 
  are also spellcasters, this can lead to a hilarious chain reaction that 
  while funny, is probably not intended to happen.
- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Thoughts on Eakauri: when your comments call it a super boss, you were 
  not joking. I'm currently trying to kill the thing, but I'm pretty sure 
  that Fae are actually incapable of it (picture related), which is- 
  lore-friendly, I suppose.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add an autosave function that triggers every time you descend or ascend. 
  The game occasionally crashes (unrepeatablely, unfortunately), which is 
  more than a little frustrating when you just descended 300' in the 
  infinite dungeon without saving.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.
