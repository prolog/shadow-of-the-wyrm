Me:
- ASSET RELEASE: sounds!
- git push --tags
- why is water breathing time so low?

  breathe water.
- let's work on recall/coming back if you go down a water tile...

- sometimes: mushroom generation in dungeons (rare), caverns (more frequent)
- open pit mine (pick axes or mattocks, gold, stone, magici...). may or may not
  be abandoned.
- generic miner npc
- YARD: let NPCs pray in desperation as well
- picking up an item - prompt (with swyrm option) re whether to equip it?
- mountaineering/lore: chance to find magici shards (+ mark tile) and also to
  generate a down staircase that leads to passageways that lead to a cavern
- issue with too many save files, but there's only one? -1
- Branding should give a base 20% resist
- mushrooms with randomized effects, descs like wildflowers. eat scripts?
- Desert/Forest/etc Lore (+ dungeoneering?): to-hit, damage, speed bonuses on

- in villages: retired cartographers?
- small chance to generate good items underwater

- Flying shop in Carcassia A2A
- need to be able to move around sky above Carcassia (make sure NW, NE, SW,
  SE all work as expected)

- timed quest for which boating would help a lot
- guaranteed one 80-100 treasure for each lore type
- boating!
  world map, only if not flying
- JE: summoning logic: deities shouldn't summon: creatures of other
  deities, undead for some, demons for some, etc.

  maybe should be:
    - allow divine, subject to the above
    - allow monsters, subject to the above
    - allow undead and demons, if config allows it
- set something on the fov_map so we can know if it's stale (time?)
  - set_as_of, get_as_of (use properties)
  - if as-of is set and != current time, CreatureUtils::... then return map
  - look at other ways
- JE: drank fortified wine in store, wine not owned by shopkeeper, shopkeeper
  remained friendly but attacked

  to fields.
- Allow wearables to give +HP, +AP
- Enchanting should rarely up HP/AP. +25 per enchant. 1-5% chance?
- Wizard staff: +50 AP
- Look at Earthsea names?
- Ensure stunned works properly for NPCs
- Weaponmasteries in guidebook
- after Godslayer, divine spells gone/Divine skill 0
- Homesteads in fields
- Use MapUtils::get_unblocked_door_dirs elsewhere
- More dungeon item features:
  - Hoard (weapons, armour, etc - trapped)
- Houses:
  - Free from Emperor when arena cleared
  - Towns could have builders/masons
  - When chatting to them, will follow, help you build, give you a scroll that
    when read sets the generation rate to 0
  - Help you build: chat with them, select features/rooms from menu, leaves
    when done
- wildflower varieties, from the descs
- wildflower seeds
- plant these like trees
- advisor
- quest for advisor in Yew

  - Give the key to a special mob
  - Deliver to Atua-Elar
  - Stage 1 of the uprising
- Make taverns more distinctive
- town repop race issue
  - set a flag in the settlement generators to set a property on the map.
  - when the property is set, set a vector<string> of creature ids as a
    property on the map
  - When running MapCreatureGenerator, check the map for that property.
    If present, generate them all.
  - Minus uniques, this will basically regenerate a village each time
- Do a couple of quests that require a party
  - Isen Dun (Hrimgar): envoy to Forest of Yew (PoGA)
- Test by generating these in Carcassia, Gnordvar
- explosive damage should also trigger destr_pct_chance items on ground.
  e.g. set up explosive fields...
- New sector features:
- UndergroundSectorFeature (takes tile type - dungeoncomplex, mine, cavern,
  sewer)
- Kure: skinning/tanning
- Other names: dungeons, caverns, sewers...
- Generate tombs with keys outside door/doors locked
- First urchin stone has no message!
- Feature: fence, east_west_fence. Add some fenced areas to set locations.
- Fenced areas (veg gardens?) in villages
- Wyrm level stupid slow?
- Need to get hirelings text-searchable in bestiary
- Creatures try to cast utility spells when they don't make sense (uncursing,
  etc). Should be checks to see if effect makes sense.
- Next release: need to do an asset release
- Sector features for regular settlements
- Things to make villages more interesting:
  - Archery ranges (contests, using ranges should train ranged, etc)
  - Graves
  - Ponds w/ benches
  - Caverns
  - Sewers
  - Mines
- Each version: make sure to update itch.io page for both SotW and the sprite
  pack! OpenGameArt if new sprites.
- Release after this: grond says tanning is complicated & dragon skins aren't
  what they should be.
- Additional profiling improvements
- Beer halls in villages
- Do creatures pause when no threats in FOV? Seems slow.
- 2x draw?
- Beastmastery: add mounts
- Grond: attacking turtles causes some kind of ToD crash after teleporting
  and maybe other stuff?
- EACH VERSION: clean up the usage of some shared_ptrs.  These should be
  unique_ptrs, generally, and method calls should use raw pointers or
  const&.
- After locking/unlocking, the next input seems to blank the entire screen.
  (This is an SDL Direct3D rendering issue with dynamically loaded textures
  becoming invalidated.)
- Do additional profiling after shared_ptr cleanup
- Look at race balance: stats, speed, skill points, etc
- Fruit trees should generate fruit annually.
- Write script to check for any items without CodexDescriptionSID
- The "descend to" functionality
- Sections of Carcassia should be open to random generation, with some
  parts of each map being set.
- "The Vertical City"
- refactor the huge function in ShadowOfTheWyrmEngine.cpp
- More guilds/things with memberships
- Improve spellcasting AI so that spells are only considered when adjacent
  if the expected damage is greater than the expected damage of a melee
  attack.
- The guarded, empty areas in Carcassia C2 should lead to some kind of
  dungeon/special area.
- More special terrain rooms, and then slightly increase the probability so
  that dungeons are more interesting.
- Penalties from bloodied, exposed should also scale with level.
- The Ybari/Asturias?
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Buildings generated in towns should automatically get inhabitants.
- Explore the cities Carcassia is built on top of.
- Wind should have a chance to "carry" flames.
- Revisit smithing.
- Do something with the Order Ex Gladiatores

- Towers/tower generators.
- Reuse some of the sector feature generators in dungeons - tomb, etc.
- Descent into the underworld.
- Wilderness ruins/lairs
- Dungeon vaults
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.  Use profiler - check out LOS code,
  pathfinding, etc.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Armour flags
- More guilds
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?
- Message when doing checkpoint saves to indicate why the delay happens.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.
- Group like items together (scrolls, etc) even if not exactly the same
- Lit FOV
- Can probably keep most of the SDL_PollEvent calls in the controller.  
  With proper framerate throttling or delays could do more interesting 
  animations, etc.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Esran:
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Sewer/dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?

kain:
- Towns not repopping with the same types of creatures as before (e.g.,
  ogres).
- Shops not generating fully stocked.

ssteam
- w->, w-< to autowalk to stairs
- Descend via '>' while in air.
- More secrets!
- Balance artifacts - mostly blades

aotdev
- Status/stats lines wrap weirdly with larger terminal sizes

happylisk:
- more diverse artifact effects (HP/AP regen, stat bonuses, etc)

naughtyusername: 
- Skill descriptions on shift+letter or something

Timo:
- Can kill off guards one by one, emperor doesn't care.

Mirza Ghalib:
- Wide displays are causing text in e.g. the Isen Dun Chronicle to
  mess up (see the section about Gnordvar). 88x25

hapro:
- Drop multiple items at once
- Option to "pause" after certain triggers. When paused the game would
  ignore all inputs until space pressed. Example triggers: dropping below
  15% health, taking more than 50% in single attack, beginning to starve,
  etc.
- Separating corpses and food into separate autopickup groups - want to
  auto pickup food, but not corpses
- Auto pickup triggers when leaving a map on a tile you're leaving from.
  e.g. Drop an item on edge of town, leave town, item picked up.

Rob Ayres
- Aging attacks and potions of youth

Troubler: 
- Doors in dungeon occasionally get spawned in a big, long line.

Grond:
- Torment-type spell (1/2 HP)
- you see flickering even in areas where LOS is blocked by a wall
- Switching with townsfolk (in churches?) leads to weird behaviour
- Adjacent creatures attack on load
- Differentiate scribing and wandcraft - why use scribing?
- could magic skill affect spell duration
- monster as a mount
- "some ivory pieces shimmers in a radiant light"
- fishing from boat, fish vanish

Yan Zhang:
- Dungeon symbol should generate that thing on the last level
- Do something interesting with flowers!
- Climb up Telari: more NPCs

Stof:
- mouse click pathfinding

mission opossumable:
- alternate tiles e.g. different grass tiles
- seconded ^^ (Valduk)

YARD:
- spell details on shift+letter
- wilderness, low level creatures, etc

IceBox: 
- can the confirm setting be allowed to change on load?

Josh Engdahl
- Rebindable paging keys
- User macros
- Add info on the weapon synopsis to the manual
- max fire res on fire spirits, etc
- support for "extending" good status effects via drinking multiple potions,
  etc
- tile selection keys not reloading with others
- when hiding and checking stuff, spirits in walls don't seem to count against
  the checks
- don't step out of shadows if creatures don't have you in LOS
- weird age incrementing issue?
- make undead hostile to e.g. all humanoids who don't worship shiver/urgoth/
  sceadugenga.
- nearby guards/priests should get angry when altars are desecrated
- Rocky earth generator 1n Carcassia
- Freeze not always working when hostile creatures in view or creatures 
  hostile to leader in view?
- los code: .@..   can't see
            ####s
- "switch" equipment - if wearing a piece of armour that's not as good as
  something on the ground, remove it, flag it as to-discard, pick up the new
  piece, wear it. There's a lot here: how do we ensure we pick up the best
  piece of armour? How do we ensure that eg other NPCs can pick up the
  discarded piece? etc

TheGhostInTheMachine:
- game segfaults if you put it on the path and then run it elsewhere?

Brian Jeffears:
- black market/something only open at night

Bentwing:
- make undead hostile to humanoids
- way of creating lock for door
- restack on blessing eg books, all items, etc
- more fleshed out NPCs/hirelings/writing generally
- keybinding for toggling reach mode

Kenny:
- repeat last command (!)

iakul:
- spells for the nine

JovanM:
- create inkpots
- paper making from anything made of wood
- long shops eg in Carcassia allow free thievery
- combine Fletchery & Bowyer

Sabrecam: 
- pay guards for peace
- should be able to see full statuses in full description

Azathoth:
The pager used for texts could also be improved by:
- enabling one line shifts with up/down (8/2) keys;
- implementing less-like search:
  - / starts search mode
  - characters and BACKSPACE edit the search string
  - ESC exits search mode
  - ENTER exits it and updates the search string
  - in normal mode, if the search string is not empty, n moves to the next match and N moves to the previous one
  - in status line, the number of matches and the current match are displayed like this: [3/17]

Similar search for inventory (filtering the items and without n/N) would also be helpful when you're looking for a particular item

Marcin Puc:
- asset, data dir
- "For context how configuring the dirs could work: either swyrm.ini gets a 
   field for pointing to the root game directory, 
   like /usr/share/shadow-of-the-wyrm/ that holds all dirs like assets, data 
   etc, or reads it from an env variable e.g. SOTW_ROOT_DIR and then distros 
   provide a wrapper script that sets it before running the game"
- switch to cmake? for automatic install

Xvordan:
- in-map waypoint system

Stevie-3:
- tab cycles through creatures, items, (+ features?) in view

davethehun: 
- witchling house might not be generated?

EruditeFigglebottom:
- customizable letterbox border colour

RelicWraith:
- Suggestion: Praying during a deity's specific holy day grants the player a gift, once per holy day. Could be just flavor items rather than anything that gives significant power (eg. a themed companion or food item). Even low piety worshipers get gifts, if not just junk...

Paul Raymond-Robichaud:
- be able to exit game to main screen
- sheep generate tame for shepherds (sheep need to actually generate then)
- shift+letter for race, class, religion help on start
- special events/festivities on certain days? (feasts, etc)
