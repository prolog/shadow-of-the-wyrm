Me:
- In the infinite dungeon, up staircases at 100' (and lower?) are going
  back to the overworld map.
- Additional "flavour" messages for each damage type.  Pound/pummel/etc.
to register a new map with the same ID as an existing map currently in the 
registry, instead of failing silently.
- Dump command for arbitrary text screens.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Add fishing, foraging
- Evil story arc
- Linux support.  
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- Some more information in-game about offering at altars
- Offer to save character dump when quitting or winning
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- New effect/scroll/cantrip - "Cleansing", which prevents new creatures
  from being generated on a map.  When cursed, flips that boolean switch
  to re-enable it (and maybe ups the danger level?)
- Crash bug is still present: find out what's causing it!
- Named in-game holidays/special days.  Should get an in-game message
  when that day occurs.
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Scrolls of uncursing, should be common, appear around d2 or 3.
- The spell of uncursing should be a wizard spell.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.
- Cursed items should bind to slot, identify as cursed.
- Include feature when drawing old areas so doors/etc don't disappear.


AgingMinotaur:
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.

Kraphead:
- monsters should cast spells
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures
- implement dual wield
- Option to keep adventuring after killing Amaurosis
- item generation: more arrows

Mateusz Lagowski
- ? for command list

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- keys to toggle monsters when looking
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.
