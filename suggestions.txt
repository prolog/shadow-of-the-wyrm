Me:
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- Initial Disarm Traps skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Evil story arc
- Linux support (get working using Fedora/Debian in VirtualBox).
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Crash bug is still present: find out what's causing it!
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Capacities on barrels, so that they don't contain an infinite amount
  of booze.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes
