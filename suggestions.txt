Me:
- Additional "flavour" messages for each damage type.  Pound/pummel/etc.
- Soak should be quartered when fighting incorporeal creatures (update docs!)
- When registering custom maps in the MapRegistry, log an error if trying 
to register a new map with the same ID as an existing map currently in the 
registry, instead of failing silently.
- Look at making the Lua code safer so that if there is an error, it
doesn't crash the entire game.

Akeley:
- ESC as well as 'z'
- Separate inventory and equipment

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.
- Resize not working properly.

AgingMinotaur:
- switching places should default to 'yes'.
* A command to display character info in-game (without dumping it in a file) would be nice.
* On a related note, I didn't feel very connected to my skills, so a way to access/display them would be nice. I get the impression that some of them aren't fully implemented yet, but also noticed that while some characters were unable to use a spinning wheel because they had no fibres to use, others reportedly didn't know how to spin.
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* Regarding inventory, I wouldn't mind if weapon/missile damage were displayed next to the item in question. As it is now, I have to equip everything and press "W" and "R" to get at that info.
* The "f"ire command is also acting a bit wonky. Sometimes it autotargets the closest enemy, sometimes is jumps to an entirely different place in the map (the last place I shot at something), and sometimes the cursor starts out over my own avatar, seemingly at random.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.
