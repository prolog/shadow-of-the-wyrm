Me:
- Additional "flavour" messages for each damage type.  Pound/pummel/etc.
to register a new map with the same ID as an existing map currently in the 
registry, instead of failing silently.
- Dump command for arbitrary text screens.
- Define two moons, and create a phase-of-moon command.
- Eventually, chances to learn spells are increased based on the type
  of magic and the phase of the moon.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Code for diagonal cone effects (test with wand of dragon breath).

Akeley:
- ESC as well as 'z'

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyrzati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.
