Me:
- Test turtle races after refactoring constant
- Use in pitmistress_ghara and turtle races
- Need to test creature generation thoroughly.
- Test random and non-random quests before release.
- Buildings generated in towns should automatically get inhabitants.
- More birds around the tower top
- More inhabitants in the base of the tower
- Quests out of Old Town
- No teleport spell!
- Sort spells by AP cost
- Sections of Carcassia should be open to random generation, with some
  parts of each map being set.
- refactor the huge function in ShadowOfTheWyrmEngine.cpp
- Dungeons and caverns should have a chance to grow magic trees.
- Tidy up scripts/quests into subdirectories, like carcassia, and test.
  Need to remember to update env.lua!
- More guilds/things with memberships
- Magical orchard (should be 2-3 over the world)
- Allow music to not only pacify but enchant (allow for ordering)
- Improve spellcasting AI so that spells are only considered when adjacent
  if the expected damage is greater than the expected damage of a melee
  attack.
- The guarded, empty areas in Carcassia C2 should lead to some kind of
  dungeon/special area.
- Summonings
- Repel (cantrip)
- Email Nathan before next release re: Mac build check
- More special terrain rooms, and then slightly increase the probability so
  that dungeons are more interesting.
- Penalties from bloodied, exposed should also scale with level.
- When items are destroyed in shops, their value should be be added to the
  unpaid bill.
- Generate loom, tanneries in random villages.
- Add shops to dungeons.
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Revisit smithing.
- Do something with the Order Ex Gladiatores
- Revisit how values are updated after enchantment.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- Creatures should have a chance to follow up/down stairs with special
  case for returning to overworld.  Chance should be based on hostility
  and an Escape roll.  Update Guidebook.
- Before making negative amulets with statuses (e.g., poisoned amulet),
  make status identifier map calculated by going through the modifiers.
  Otherwise, it's stupid trying to figure out if a creature is still
  poisoned: e.g., a creature is poisoned, and then puts on a poisoned
  amulet.  Should still be poisoned when either of the two wear off.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  are 2.
- Allow shopkeepers to be any of the selectable races.
- Towers/tower generators.
- Reuse some of the sector feature generators in dungeons - tomb, etc.
- Descent into the underworld.
- Allow shopkeepers to sell for different prices depending on their
  race, and the buying creature's.
- Wilderness ruins/lairs
- Dungeon vaults
- Arcane damage should destroy wands, rings, potions, scrolls, texts,
  some of the time (30%).  There should be a 10% chance of actually
  enchanting the item, though.  Try to limit to "magic only".
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.  Use profiler - check out LOS code,
  pathfinding, etc.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Guilds and membership, mutual exclusivity, etc.
- In-game gambling: arena fights, games of chance, etc.
- LOS reduction at night-time, can be negated by skill in Blindfighting.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Recall spell that takes you back to the overworld.
- Armour flags
- Cantrip to set glow flag on items
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?
- Message when doing checkpoint saves to indicate why the delay happens.

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.

Esran:
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Sewer/dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?

ais523:
- Being able to read a savefile should be based on file permissions,
  not a username check.  Keep username for highscore list.

kain:
- way to see resists on item without equipping
- Zapped wand moves to end of inventory?
- Towns not repopping with the same types of creatures as before (e.g.,
  ogres).
- Autorun: stop at intersections in sewers.
- Holy presence but no altars?
- Shops not generating fully stocked.

kraphead
- Crashes in sewer, SE dungeon
- black 'x'
- Cascade of aggro on stun, etc
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

ssteam
- w->, w-< to autowalk to stairs
- Descend via '>' while in air.
- More secrets!
- Balance artifacts - mostly blades

aotdev
- Status/stats lines wrap weirdly with larger terminal sizes

Troubler
- Multiple pages of items, eventually hits blank page that when hitting ,
  or . gives the right page.
