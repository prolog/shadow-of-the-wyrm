Me:
- New spell: vorpal bolt
- Clean up the Lua code to require + use the new constants
- Traps that fire and kill a creature are giving the player exp?
- Equipping from a stack of rings (maybe other objects, too) doesn't
  properly identify on use.
- Update ResistancesTranslator to make use of Resistance::get_value_str()
- Test clearing all shrines
- Implement proper branded weapons.  These should allow for any "magical"
  damage type (heat through lightning in the damage enum) to be the weapon
  damage instead.  Should also allow for chaotic or piercing flags.  Gives
  extra dice or modifier.  Should have "branded" flag on Weapon, config
  as necessary during item generation.  Have one weapon for each of the
  melee weapon groups, and ranged ammunition.  Remove all the individual
  branded-like items from the game configuration.
- Implement a draining flag (50% chance return 1/4 damage to attacker).
- Ensure item describers properly handle the brads, plus draining/vorpal/
  piercing/chaotic.
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Linux support (get working using Fedora/Debian in VirtualBox).
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Crash bug is still present: find out what's causing it!
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Capacities on barrels, so that they don't contain an infinite amount
  of booze.
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Now that damage slays, and not weapons, ensure that magical damage/traps
  and so on properly check slays.
- Discover traps on search?  Passive search at the end of each turn for
  traps?

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

Legend:
- Pick up all
- Option to always prompt on stack pickup

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes
