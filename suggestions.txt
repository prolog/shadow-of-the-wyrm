Me:
- Additional "flavour" messages for each damage type.  Pound/pummel/etc.
to register a new map with the same ID as an existing map currently in the 
registry, instead of failing silently.
- Dump command for arbitrary text screens.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Add fishing, foraging
- Evil story arc
- Create an "unidentified items" filter for Idem
- Linux support.  
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- Some more information in-game about offering at altars
- Offer to save character dump when quitting or winning
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- "Dug" (and therefore planted) status should only apply to terra firma,
  so add some checks for water/air tiles to disallow dug status.
- New effect/scroll/cantrip - "Cleansing", which prevents new creatures
  from being generated on a map.  When cursed, flips that boolean switch
  to re-enable it (and maybe ups the danger level?)

Akeley:
- ESC as well as 'z'
- too much food/spellbooks?

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.

Kraphead:
- monsters should cast spells
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures
- implement dual wield
- Option to keep adventuring after killing Amaurosis
- scale down enchantments - too powerful!
- option for never moving on to dangerous terrain.
- two moon amulet not being removed when wearing - bug is in
  ItemManager::remove_item_from_eq_or_inv
- artifact boots
- item generation: more arrows, more ivory, other things not generating
  as expected?  Are scrolls even generating?
- fix the message when a stunned monster does an incorporeal attack on
  itself.

Mateusz Lagowski
- ? for command list
- Move monsters back via kick
