kraphead:
- There's some sort of spell crash in the Wyrmeswraec temple with Lich
  Kings and their fire spells.
- Crash (no dump) when automoving by a grey 'u'?  What else can access
  pointers turn to turn?  Traps?  Spells?  Creature decision/LOS code?

Me:
- Allow spearfishing.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  are 2.
- Creatures should be smarter about the use of spells given that creatures
  will fight back and summon help.
- Arcane damage should destroy wands, rings, potions, scrolls, texts,
  some of the time (30%).  There should be a 10% chance of actually
  enchanting the item, though.  Try to limit to "magic only".
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- Small chance to search surrounding tiles when moving.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Poison effects on a tile should poison any food.
- Traps that fire and kill a creature are giving the player exp?
- Test clearing all shrines
- Implement proper branded weapons.  These should allow for any "magical"
  damage type (heat through lightning in the damage enum) to be the weapon
  damage instead.  Should also allow for chaos/pierce/eth flags.  Gives
  extra dice or modifier.  Should have "branded" flag on Weapon, config
  as necessary during item generation.  Have one weapon for each of the
  melee weapon groups, and ranged ammunition.  Remove all the individual
  branded-like items from the game configuration.
- Ensure item describers properly handle the brands, plus draining/vorpal/
  piercing/chaotic.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- Travelling bazaars.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Telari, the Drowned Isle
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Passive search at the end of each turn for traps?
- Guilds and membership, mutual exclusivity, etc.
- In-game gambling: arena fights, games of chance, etc.
- LOS reduction at night-time, can be negated by skill in Blindfighting.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Add splitting behaviour to all jellies: when hit, they have some
  chance (10-20%?) of splitting.  Each creature in the split has half
  the current HP of the original.
- Witchthorns should have a chance of doing a 1 dmg piercing attack.

Anon: 
- Look into resists and crits - had Heat -0.05, got one-shot by Eakauri

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

Legend:
- Option to always prompt on stack pickup

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

- The Snakeling Tower repeatedly crashes the game once you reach the 
  center of the second floor; you may skirt the edges as long as you wish, 
  but once you reach a certain distance from the center (probably the 
  limit of your LoS), it crashes.

- Sometimes, the stone key that you pick up on the stairs in RNG crypts 
  does not fit the lock on the sealed tomb.


Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- The dawn/dusk filters color everything but items/characters, while the 
  night filter colors everything. That is; during dawn/dusk, items appear 
  as normal, but once it turns to night, everything goes vaguely blue.
- Spellcasting enemies have a tendency to hit all their friends with 
  spells and get smashed even without your intervention. If their friends 
  are also spellcasters, this can lead to a hilarious chain reaction that 
  while funny, is probably not intended to happen.
- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Leading off of that, the (w)alk command doesn't actually stop when 
  damage happens. I know this because the #4 "Not bug but probably not 
  working as intended" killed two characters of mine in the same way; I 
  would engage the (w)alk command and head down an unexplored corridor. 
  As I neared a corner, I would suddenly be hit by a fireball from an 
  unseen Lich; the (w)alk continued undeterred, the fireball casting did 
  too, and so two steps later I was dead without the chance to make even a 
  single move.
- Similarly, resting while blind doesn't stop if you're attacked by an 
  unseen monster.
- The gem-shrines aren't "permanent." Like any given forest or field tile, 
  they don't have persistent item memory; if you don't get the Gem on the 
  first attempt, it's gone forever. Also like any given forest or field 
  tile, tombs and graves may spawn that make it permanent.
- Thoughts on Eka: how are you "supposed" to get in there? I found it only 
  by accident, and I was only able to enter Eakarui's prison cell by that 
  digging oversight. As far as I can tell, only a few books and Thengil 
  even mention the place; it has totally stumped me.
- Thoughts on Eakauri: when your comments call it a super boss, you were 
  not joking. I'm currently trying to kill the thing, but I'm pretty sure 
  that Fae are actually incapable of it (picture related), which is- 
  lore-friendly, I suppose.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add an autosave function that triggers every time you descend or ascend. 
  The game occasionally crashes (unrepeatablely, unfortunately), which is 
  more than a little frustrating when you just descended 300' in the 
  infinite dungeon without saving.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.
