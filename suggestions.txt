Me:
- Do the mine generation issue.  Rewrite MineGenerator - should create 
  levels like the DW mines.
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Small chance to search surrounding tiles when moving.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Poison effects on a tile should poison any food.
- Traps that fire and kill a creature are giving the player exp?
- Test clearing all shrines
- Implement proper branded weapons.  These should allow for any "magical"
  damage type (heat through lightning in the damage enum) to be the weapon
  damage instead.  Should also allow for chaos/pierce/eth flags.  Gives
  extra dice or modifier.  Should have "branded" flag on Weapon, config
  as necessary during item generation.  Have one weapon for each of the
  melee weapon groups, and ranged ammunition.  Remove all the individual
  branded-like items from the game configuration.
- Ensure item describers properly handle the brands, plus draining/vorpal/
  piercing/chaotic.
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- Travelling bazaars.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Telari, the Drowned Isle
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Passive search at the end of each turn for traps?
- Guilds and membership, mutual exclusivity, etc.
- In-game gambling: arena fights, games of chance, etc.
- LOS reduction at night-time, can be negated by skill in Blindfighting.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

VedVid:
- 207x66 - try reading text, all fu'd.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

Legend:
- Option to always prompt on stack pickup

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:
bugs:
- In the manticore/gnome mine quest, the manticore will occasionally spawn 
  in a cavern system with no path to the stairs.
- Eating on the world map takes significantly more time than eating 
  anywhere that isn't a world map tile. To see this, eat olives repeatedly
  on the world map; they provide so little nutrition that you can actually 
  starve to death while gorging yourself on them.

Suggestions:

- Make hunger less prohibitive on the world map, or make food easier to 
  acquire. Currently, you have to eat every time you travel about 1/4 the 
  length of a world map screen. Given how large the world map is, and how 
  far apart most of the interesting things are, this means you need a lot 
  of food. The easiest way to get food involves grinding that small field 
  on the starter island for lots of fruit. The alternative is grinding 
  monsters for corpses. Neither are particularly challenging or fun, just 
  tedious. Suggestions for solutions:
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add an autosave function that triggers every time you descend or ascend. 
  The game occasionally crashes (unrepeatablely, unfortunately), which is 
  more than a little frustrating when you just descended 300' in the 
  infinite dungeon without saving.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.
