Me:
- Unit tests for everything in CurrentCreatureAbilities!
- Linux: check premake scripts for commands/order
- Beastmastery: add mounts
- Music, Leadership: 
- Narrative mode (no death, death removes negative statuses + heals)
- Each version: make sure to update itch.io page for both SotW and the sprite
  pack! OpenGameArt if new sprites.
- Release after this: grond says tanning is complicated & dragon skins aren't
  what they should be.
- Leadership/music: give orders.
- Leadership: get followers who can follow you up/down floors
- Have followers change floor and tracked on eg world map
- Use Magic to destroy spellbooks and get a bit of AP?
- Dungeons should check for shop before generating trap.
- Beer halls in villages
- spell arcana (bind to capitals in spell list)
- auto save - not working?
- Do creatures pause when no threats in FOV? Seems slow.
- Things to make villages more interesting:
  - Archery ranges (contests, using ranges should train ranged, etc)
  - Graves
  - Ponds w/ benches
  - Caverns
  - Sewers
  - Mines
  - fenced area with gate: pigs, chickens
  - stream
  - tavern
  - orchard
- google screen clear not working for SDL. reported 2x.
- 2x draw?
- Grond: attacking turtles causes some kind of ToD crash after teleporting
  and maybe other stuff?
- EACH VERSION: clean up the usage of some shared_ptrs.  These should be
  unique_ptrs, generally, and method calls should use raw pointers or
  const&.
- After locking/unlocking, the next input seems to blank the entire screen.
  (This is an SDL Direct3D rendering issue with dynamically loaded textures
  becoming invalidated.)
- Do additional profiling after shared_ptr cleanup
- Look at race balance: stats, speed, skill points, etc
- Shield punch!
- Fruit trees should generate fruit annually.
- Write script to check for any items without CodexDescriptionSID
- The "descend to" functionality
- Sections of Carcassia should be open to random generation, with some
  parts of each map being set.
- "The Vertical City"
- refactor the huge function in ShadowOfTheWyrmEngine.cpp
- Tidy up scripts/quests into subdirectories, like carcassia, and test.
  Need to remember to update env.lua!
- More guilds/things with memberships
- Allow music to not only pacify but enchant (allow for ordering)
- Improve spellcasting AI so that spells are only considered when adjacent
  if the expected damage is greater than the expected damage of a melee
  attack.
- The guarded, empty areas in Carcassia C2 should lead to some kind of
  dungeon/special area.
- Summonings
- Email Nathan before next release re: Mac build check
- More special terrain rooms, and then slightly increase the probability so
  that dungeons are more interesting.
- Penalties from bloodied, exposed should also scale with level.
- The Ybari/Asturias?
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Buildings generated in towns should automatically get inhabitants.
- Explore the cities Carcassia is built on top of.
- Wind should have a chance to "carry" flames.
- Revisit smithing.
- Do something with the Order Ex Gladiatores
- Revisit how values are updated after enchantment.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- The vaults of the old dwarven-kings
- Creatures should have a chance to follow up/down stairs with special
  case for returning to overworld.  Chance should be based on hostility
  and an Escape roll.  Update Guidebook.
- Before making negative amulets with statuses (e.g., poisoned amulet),
  make status identifier map calculated by going through the modifiers.
  Otherwise, it's stupid trying to figure out if a creature is still
  poisoned: e.g., a creature is poisoned, and then puts on a poisoned
  amulet.  Should still be poisoned when either of the two wear off.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  and caverns are 2.
- Allow shopkeepers to be any of the selectable races.
- Towers/tower generators.
- Reuse some of the sector feature generators in dungeons - tomb, etc.
- Descent into the underworld.
- Allow shopkeepers to sell for different prices depending on their
  race, and the buying creature's.
- Wilderness ruins/lairs
- Dungeon vaults
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- SDL: full screen
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.  Use profiler - check out LOS code,
  pathfinding, etc.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Armour flags
- More guilds
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?
- Message when doing checkpoint saves to indicate why the delay happens.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.
- Group like items together (scrolls, etc) even if not exactly the same
- Lit FOV
- Can probably keep most of the SDL_PollEvent calls in the controller.  
  With proper framerate throttling or delays could do more interesting 
  animations, etc.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.

Esran:
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Sewer/dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?

kain:
- Zapped wand moves to end of inventory?
- Towns not repopping with the same types of creatures as before (e.g.,
  ogres).
- Shops not generating fully stocked.

ssteam
- w->, w-< to autowalk to stairs
- Descend via '>' while in air.
- More secrets!
- Balance artifacts - mostly blades

aotdev
- Status/stats lines wrap weirdly with larger terminal sizes

happylisk:
- more diverse artifact effects (HP/AP regen, stat bonuses, etc)

naughtusername: 
- Skill descriptions on shift+letter or something

Timo:
- Can kill off guards one by one, emperor doesn't care.

Mirza Ghalib:
- Wide displays are causing text in e.g. the Isen Dun Chronicle to
  mess up (see the section about Gnordvar). 88x25

vedvid:
- rebind '*' (vedvid)

hapro:
- Numpad enter key does not always work same as real enter key
- Drop multiple items at once
- Walking on an object/feature should put the exmaine message in the log
- Option to "pause" after certain triggers. When paused the game would
  ignore all inputs until space pressed. Example triggers: dropping below
  15% health, taking more than 50% in single attack, beginning to starve,
  etc.
- Separating corpses and food into separate autopickup groups - want to
  auto pickup food, but not corpses
- Auto pickup triggers when leaving a map on a tile you're leaving from.
  e.g. Drop an item on edge of town, leave town, item picked up.

Rob Ayres
- Aging attacks and potions of youth

Troubler: 
- Doors in dungeon occasionally get spawned in a big, long line.

Grond:
- Torment-type spell (1/2 HP)
- you see flickering even in areas where LOS is blocked by a wall
- Switching with townsfolk (in churches?) leads to weird behaviour
- Adjacent creatures attack on load
- Differentiate scribing and wandcraft - why use scribing?
- Scything on ammo?
- could magic skill affect spell duration
- monster as a mount

Yan Zhang:
- Dungeon symbol should generate that thing on the last level
- Do something interesting with flowers!
- Climb up Telari: more NPCs

Skjarl:
- SDL resizing

Stof:
- mouse click pathfinding

mission opossumable:
- alternate tiles e.g. different grass tiles
- seconded ^^ (Valduk)

YARD:
- creatures of a certain deity (frostlings and shiver, black servants and
  sceadugenga) shouldn't attack you if you worship that deity
- spell details on shift+letter

IceBox: 
- can the confirm setting be allowed to change on load?

Larzid
- display type a command line arg
- SDL as a build param
