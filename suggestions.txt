Me:
- Corpses not turning into statues properly.
- Archery issues again?  Firing shadow bombs at apprentice in Isen Dun,
  some don't seem to reach the whole way.
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Avoid triggering known traps with high Alertness.
- Revisit smithing.
- Revisit how values are updated after enchantment.
- Magic mappings effect.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- Creatures should have a chance to follow up/down stairs with special
  case for returning to overworld.  Chance should be based on hostility
  and an Escape roll.  Update Guidebook.
- Before making negative amulets with statuses (e.g., poisoned amulet),
  make status identifier map calculated by going through the modifiers.
  Otherwise, it's stupid trying to figure out if a creature is still
  poisoned: e.g., a creature is poisoned, and then puts on a poisoned
  amulet.  Should still be poisoned when either of the two wear off.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  are 2.
- Allow shopkeepers to be any of the selectable races.
- Allow shopkeepers to sell for different prices dependending on their
  race, and the buying creature's.
- Creatures should be smarter about the use of spells given that creatures
  will fight back and summon help.
- Exploding arrows.
- Arcane damage should destroy wands, rings, potions, scrolls, texts,
  some of the time (30%).  There should be a 10% chance of actually
  enchanting the item, though.  Try to limit to "magic only".
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Travelling bazaars (make fields/deserts/hills permanent).
- Add shops to the random villages.
- Add shops to dungeons.
- Merchants should get half off in shops.
- Initial Music skill implementation.
- You should be able to ride the bucket down to the bottom of wells.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Stores
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Telari, the Drowned Isle
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Guilds and membership, mutual exclusivity, etc.
- In-game gambling: arena fights, games of chance, etc.
- LOS reduction at night-time, can be negated by skill in Blindfighting.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Recall spell that takes you back to the overworld.
- Armour flags
- Cantrip to set glow flag on items
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?

Larzid:
- Some sort of bank to ease the burden of carrying so much currency.

Rob Ayres:
- Auto-fish/eat when travelling over water and having a spear/fishing rod.
- Mark health when taking damage from a creature of your danger level or
  higher.
- HP/AP not being affected by stats on stat gain or level.

Anon: 
- Look into resists and crits - had Heat -0.05, got one-shot by Eakauri
- Increase stat-based damage bonuses

For v1:
- Item generation needs a serious overhaul!  Many items are rarely, if 
  ever, generated.
- Revisit creature generation algorithm.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

Legend:
- Option to always prompt on stack pickup

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies have a tendency to hit all their friends with 
  spells and get smashed even without your intervention. If their friends 
  are also spellcasters, this can lead to a hilarious chain reaction that 
  while funny, is probably not intended to happen.
- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Thoughts on Eakauri: when your comments call it a super boss, you were 
  not joking. I'm currently trying to kill the thing, but I'm pretty sure 
  that Fae are actually incapable of it (picture related), which is- 
  lore-friendly, I suppose.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add an autosave function that triggers every time you descend or ascend. 
  The game occasionally crashes (unrepeatablely, unfortunately), which is 
  more than a little frustrating when you just descended 300' in the 
  infinite dungeon without saving.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.

Esran:
- Allow keybindings to be updated after reloading.
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?
