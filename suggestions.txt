Me:
- Additional "flavour" messages for each damage type.  Pound/pummel/etc.
to register a new map with the same ID as an existing map currently in the 
registry, instead of failing silently.
- Dump command for arbitrary text screens.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Add fishing, foraging
- Evil story arc
- Create an "unidentified items" filter for Idem
- Linux support.  
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- Some more information in-game about offering at altars
- Character in the orchard who lets you change names.
- Include creature level in to-hit calculations
- Offer to save character dump when quitting or winning
- In CombatManager, add a small chance to auto-hit in the same way that
  there is a chance to auto-miss.

Akeley:
- ESC as well as 'z'
- random character.  random character generation steps (e.g., random
  race but select class).
- too much food/spellbooks?
- HP/AP should include statistics in the regeneration calcs

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.

Kraphead:
- monsters should cast spells
- evade overpowered?
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures
- implement dual wield
- Wiki!
- Option to keep adventuring after killing Amaurosis
- scale down enchantments - too powerful!
- evade very powerful
