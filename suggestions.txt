Me:
- 4chan: resists non-obvious (maybe add "Res" to the start)
- 4chan found a bug where one of the spellbooks' description SIDs isn't
  showing up (make a Python script to look up sets of resource strings
  against a given ini).
- Update gaining resists so that the delta needs to be more than a certain
  amount before you get something from a corpse.
- Add a "resting counter" to the message manager: ie, "Resting...(1/100)"
- Per-level skill increases (general, melee, ranged, magic).
- Messages when you damage a creature below certain hit point thresholds.
- Dump command for arbitrary text screens.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Multi-map areas (the central city!)
- Add fishing, foraging
- Evil story arc
- Linux support.  
- Investigate targetting not staying properly some (all?) of the time.
- Offer to save character dump when quitting or winning
- General performance improvements.
- Item generation: get rarity working properly, and then do some test
  runs.  Once that works, create some more artifacts/great items for
  random generation.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Crash bug is still present: find out what's causing it!
- Named in-game holidays/special days.  Should get an in-game message
  when that day occurs.
- Update MapTester config so that "generation runs" of creatures and
  items can be done and dumped to disk.

Dave Keen:
- way too long to regen HP
- incorporeal creatures in closed doors can't be attacked

barrabus: 
- Extra descs for items.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.
- Cursed items should bind to slot, identify as cursed.
- Include feature when drawing old areas so doors/etc don't disappear.


AgingMinotaur:
* Also, a command to display the keybindings would be nice. Ie. pressing "?" might bring up a list of commands, please?
* The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
* I noticed that archers and goblin pelters don't actually shoot anything. I'm supposing this will show up later.

Kraphead:
- auto-displace when bumping friendly creatures
- implement dual wield
- Option to keep adventuring after killing Amaurosis
- item generation: more arrows

Mateusz Lagowski
- ? for command list

Lagi:
- something to allow "breaking" walking.  Eg., if a key is pressed, stop.
- keys to toggle monsters when looking
- alternative inventory management: when in the stateless inventory
  screen ("I"), items should be selectable, and then another menu should
  be overlaid allowing equipping into various slots, dropping, evoking,
  drinking, and so on.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes
