Grond's v112 bugs:
- Switching with townsfolk (in churches?) leads to weird behaviour
- Adjacent creatures attack on load
- Timewalking in the tower is weird display-wise
- Golden apple trees don't seem to produce any fruit
- Smithing a stack of items improves all items in that stack

Me:
- Turn off the savefile flags before the next release
- Cantrip to set glow flag on items
- Grond: attacking turtles causes some kind of ToD crash after teleporting
  and maybe other stuff?
- Add water breathing to codex
- Look at race balance: stats, speed, skill points, etc
- Shield punch!
- Write script to check for any items without CodexDescriptionSID
- Can fix the turtle races by attacking two of the turtles
- Random villages should include the race in the description prior to
  generation.
- Each version: make sure to update itch.io page!
- Rework creature generation to be faster and not to bias towards the
  creatures at the front of the list.  This could be as simple as
  shuffling the order.
- The "descend to" functionality
- Sections of Carcassia should be open to random generation, with some
  parts of each map being set.
- "The Vertical City"
- refactor the huge function in ShadowOfTheWyrmEngine.cpp
- Tidy up scripts/quests into subdirectories, like carcassia, and test.
  Need to remember to update env.lua!
- More guilds/things with memberships
- Magical orchard (should be 2-3 over the world)
- Allow music to not only pacify but enchant (allow for ordering)
- Improve spellcasting AI so that spells are only considered when adjacent
  if the expected damage is greater than the expected damage of a melee
  attack.
- The guarded, empty areas in Carcassia C2 should lead to some kind of
  dungeon/special area.
- Summonings
- Clump of bog iron for swamps
- Email Nathan before next release re: Mac build check
- More special terrain rooms, and then slightly increase the probability so
  that dungeons are more interesting.
- Penalties from bloodied, exposed should also scale with level.
- When items are destroyed in shops, their value should be be added to the
  unpaid bill.
- The Ybari/Asturias?
- Add shops to dungeons.
- Negative rings/amulets: ring of poison, spellbound amulet.
- Names should work into combat messages, etc
- Buildings generated in towns should automatically get inhabitants.
- Explore the cities Carcassia is built on top of.
- Revisit smithing.
- Do something with the Order Ex Gladiatores
- Revisit how values are updated after enchantment.
- Unnecessary refresh being called for generator? (refreshing overworld
  when it shouldn't)
- The vaults of the old dwarven-kings
- Creatures should have a chance to follow up/down stairs with special
  case for returning to overworld.  Chance should be based on hostility
  and an Escape roll.  Update Guidebook.
- Before making negative amulets with statuses (e.g., poisoned amulet),
  make status identifier map calculated by going through the modifiers.
  Otherwise, it's stupid trying to figure out if a creature is still
  poisoned: e.g., a creature is poisoned, and then puts on a poisoned
  amulet.  Should still be poisoned when either of the two wear off.
- Maps should have "pack multipliers".  Most are 1, sewers are 0, mines
  are 2.
- Allow shopkeepers to be any of the selectable races.
- Towers/tower generators.
- Reuse some of the sector feature generators in dungeons - tomb, etc.
- Descent into the underworld.
- Allow shopkeepers to sell for different prices depending on their
  race, and the buying creature's.
- Wilderness ruins/lairs
- Dungeon vaults
- Arcane damage should destroy wands, rings, potions, scrolls, texts,
  some of the time (30%).  There should be a 10% chance of actually
  enchanting the item, though.  Try to limit to "magic only".
- In text display screen, p to page to a particular page.
- Arae-of-the-Woods, the first dryad.  Very fast (speed 7?), always runs
  away from the player, hits incredibly hard when attacked.  Chatting to
  her grants a wish.  She should have a chance of vanishing, which then
  decrements her generated counter to ensure she can appear again.  There
  should be a creature that talks about her.
- Craft different launchers/projectiles as skill increases.
- Some sort of ship area - raiders, ghost ship, etc.
- z-maps for settlements: test flying between multi-level maps and going
  up/down stairs.
- Set a number of artifacts with danger levels > -1, so that they can be
  generated.
- Cancellation effect type
- Special rooms: beer hall, magical workshop, armory.
- More shops in set locations.
- Keep marking general skills as applicable when using them.
- Scent maps/track by scent.
- Bones files
- More monsters with special attacks or death events.
- Code should handle being started from outside the game's directory.
- Additional phase-of-moon effects.
- Remove need for zlib and xerces by making everything statically linked.
- Different types of branches (species) should have different wand
  properties.
- General performance improvements.  Use profiler - check out LOS code,
  pathfinding, etc.
- Potion components of some sort?  Weeds should be "pickable"?
- Cauldrons, then potion-brewing, based on the brewing ability.
- Per-tile fertility ratings for planting trees and other plants.  Fields
  should give you a great chance, beaches very small, etc.
- Update MapTester config for generation runs of creatures
- Define all monsters as good/neutral/evil
- Monsters should have a chance of being generated friendly when same
  alignment.
- Sacrifices should generate more piety when non-aligned.
- Invisibility status, spell, potion
- See Invis status, spell, scroll
- More poem fragments for start.
- Smarter pack logic: not just by creature type, but maybe by race, etc.
- Weather, weather patterns, effects
- Recall spell that takes you back to the overworld.
- Armour flags
- More guilds
- Food rotting for caught fish, other foods?
- Message when doing checkpoint saves to indicate why the delay happens.

Sean McKeague:
- Ability to pick up partial stacks.

redfeek:
- Add wide char support to more easily support UTF-8/Russian translation.

Kyzrati:
- Over time, generation of new random uniques, etc.
- Different in-game event when inhabitants of certain places have aged,
  died, etc.
- Group like items together (scrolls, etc) even if not exactly the same
- Wants item-iary.  Separate screen + in inventory view.  Update lower
  message to be [A...] Info or [A...] Select based on context.
- Lit FOV
- Do something around accidentally spamming keys and training unwanted
  skills.

Avagart:
- Eventually, have automovement stop only on new items.

AgingMinotaur:
- The "w"alk command isn't very practical at the moment, IMHO. It would be better if it behaved more like typical roguelikes, ie. stopping when you pass over an object or reach a forking path.
- Stop walking on feature/branching corridor.

roguecastergames:
- sea monsters
- pirates
- ambushes

Dallas Herrin:

Not bugs, but probably not working as intended:

- Spellcasting enemies, specifically the ones that have large AoE ball 
  spells, have a tendency to cast their spells around corners, hitting you 
  up to three times without ever seeing you.
- Make it obvious somewhere how much certain spells do, and what mechanical
  effect increasing spell levels has.
- Add the ability to make macros and/or adjust the letters that spells map 
  to. The useful buff spells that one might use regularly are currently 
  being distributed at random throughout the many non-buff spells that one 
  rarely uses. Even hotkeys would improve this by a great deal.

Samildanach:
- Make it more obvious what skills do and how they work.

Esran:
- Once monsters are smarter, create spells that allow hitting monsters
  past walls.
- Sewer/dungeons: when random, prompt for "descend to what depth (ft)?

ais523:
- Being able to read a savefile should be based on file permissions,
  not a username check.  Keep username for highscore list.

kain:
- way to see resists on item without equipping
- Zapped wand moves to end of inventory?
- Towns not repopping with the same types of creatures as before (e.g.,
  ogres).
- Autorun: stop at intersections in sewers.
- Holy presence but no altars?
- Shops not generating fully stocked.

kraphead
- Crashes in sewer, SE dungeon
- black 'x'
- Cascade of aggro on stun, etc

ssteam
- w->, w-< to autowalk to stairs
- Descend via '>' while in air.
- More secrets!
- Balance artifacts - mostly blades

aotdev
- Status/stats lines wrap weirdly with larger terminal sizes

happylisk:
- buff shrine guardians (doable at 25)
- more diverse artifact effects (HP/AP regen, stat bonuses, etc)

naughtusername: 
- Skill descriptions on shift+letter or something
- automove can end with digging and then stop
- fishing up items
- weapon types in codex

Timo:
- Can kill off guards one by one, emperor doesn't care.

Mirza Ghalib:
- Wide displays are causing text in e.g. the Isen Dun Chronicle to
  mess up (see the section about Gnordvar). 88x25

NoCreativeNames:
- Nobles start with scribing, but can't really use it because they don't
  have Cantrips.  Add a quest at some point to be able to learn Cantrips.

vedvid:
- rebind '*' (vedvid)

hapro:
- Numpad enter key does not always work same as real enter key
- Drop multiple items at once
- Colour to message log
- Walking on an object/feature should put the exmaine message in the log
- If try to sell item but price refused, stay in inventory?
- Option to "pause" after certain triggers. When paused the game would
  ignore all inputs until space pressed. Example triggers: dropping below
  15% health, taking more than 50% in single attack, beginning to starve,
  etc.
- Auto-pickup ammo fired by player
- Separating corpses and food into separate autopickup groups - want to
  auto pickup food, but not corpses
- Auto pickup triggers when leaving a map on a tile you're leaving from.
  e.g. Drop an item on edge of town, leave town, item picked up.

Rob Ayres
- Aging attacks and potions of youth

Grond:
- Can train up fae health by waiting forever
- Torment-type spell (1/2 HP)
- you see flickering even in areas where LOS is blocked by a wall
- also when you move the cursor around with look, stuff flickers in LOS 
  range around the cursor
- cross spells affects rock tiles around you, shouldn't
- how is skinning stacks of corpses handled?  seems to be one skin on
  success or zero on failure, regardless of stack size

Yan Zhang:
- Dungeon symbol should generate that thing on the last level
- Do something interesting with flowers!
- Climb up Telari: more NPCs, disallow backing out?
- Sun Gem: ploughman should teach herbalism
- Bless should cost more AP, allow selection from eq
- Door in the south of the air of the keep
- Health approximation

Twelve:
- Option to make skill selection capitalization only

Klapaucius: 
- Going into an item screen (e.g., for eating), codexing an item, and
  then cancelling actually selects that item.
