Savage Lands is a roguelike game in the spirit of Omega and ADOM.  It provides a large, explorable world, in addition to dungeons, caverns, and other traditional roguelike elements.

Savage Lands is, specifically:

  1. Written in C++, with the XML game data described by a well-defined
  schema.  Libraries used include ncurses, xerces-c, and Google Test.
  
  2. Intended that the game should be playable via old terminals and
  over telnet.

  2. A roguelike for people who like roguelikes.  It is not simple,
  streamlined, or easy.  There are commands to learn.  Those commands
  will help you play faster and more efficiently.

  3. Inspired by ADOM's combination of static and dynamic elements, and
  deep gameplay.  And, there will always be dwarves.
