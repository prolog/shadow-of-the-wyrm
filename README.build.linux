Building Shadow of the Wyrm, Linux Edition

Shadow of the Wyrm can be built using premake4 and makefiles.  Before you
start, ensure you have your distribution's developer packages for:

- premake4
- Boost (1.60)
- Google Test 1.7, if you want to build debug mode, which includes unit 
  tests
- Xerces-C 3.1
- Zlib-1.2.8
- ncurses or equivalent
- Lua 5.1

You will also need to know where your libraries are installed, and update
the location in "copy_libs.lua" appropriately.  The values in that file are
valid for 64-bit Fedora 24 (/usr/lib64).

To create the makefile, run "premake4 gmake".  Build the makefile with
"make config=release".  This should build the game and copy the necessary
files into a "sotw" subdirectory.  It will take a while.  There are a lot of
translation units.  Sorry.

The Linux build has been tested using g++.

Happy hacking!
