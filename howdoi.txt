"How do I mod this thing, anyway?!"

A Brief Guide to Basic Modding for Shadow of the Wyrm

- To edit game data, edit data/ShadowOfTheWyrm.xml.  Its structure is
  defined by data/ShadowOfTheWyrm.xsd, so if you use an editor like
  Notepad++, you can use Alt+Shift+Ctrl+M to validate the updated XML
  against the schema.  The various values for effects, damage types, etc.,
  are provided in the XSD, and will typically provide references back to
  where the details of those types can be found in the engine's C++
  code.

- Resource strings are defined in shadowofthewyrm_blank.ini, and also
  in each language-specific resource strings file.  So if you were
  wanting to edit a resource string, edit shadowofthewyrm_en.ini.  To
  add a new one, add it to the blank resource strings file, and then to
  your language-specific file, giving it its actual value there.

- To add a new map, create a new XML file in data/maps.  Your XML should
  validate against CustomMap.xsd.  To place that map somewhere on the
  world map, add a new entry to data/maps/world/WorldMapAreas.xml.  Make
  sure your map has a unique ID!

- The Guidebook is located in docs/src, and is written in LaTeX.  To
  generate the PDF, you'll need to run "generate_docs.sh" in the src
  folder.  You'll need to run it twice to updated the content as well as
  the table of contents, since LaTeX is single-pass.  You'll need an 
  environment with the Bourne shell (e.g., MinGW) to run the shell
  script properly.

- Lua scripts are located in the scripts folder.  If you're adding a new
  subfolder, be sure to edit scripts/env.lua so that the new folder is
  considered when the game starts up.  To see what functions are
  available, look at engine/scripting/include/LuaAPIFunctions.hpp (for
  the list) and engine/scripting/source/LuaAPIFunctions.cpp (to see
  what kinds of parameters are expected).  

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Some Lua scripts (typically, those run directly by the
  engine, rather than the scripts that register functions to be called from
  lookup tables), when run, will cause the game to crash if there is an 
  error in your Lua code.  I will look at improving this at some point in 
  the future, but for the moment, be careful with your Lua code!
