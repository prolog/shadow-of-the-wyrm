Building Shadow of the Wyrm, Mac OS Edition

See README.build.linux - most of the same will apply.  There are a couple
of changes you will need to make to build the game, however:

Run premake4, perhaps with something like:

  premake4 --boost_thread=boost_thread-mt gmake

After running premake4, edit ShadowOfTheWyrm.make, and at the end of the
CFLAGS for each configuration, add "--std=c++14"

Otherwise, the same process and commands should apply.  Build using
make.
