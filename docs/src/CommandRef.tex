\section{Commands}

\subsection{Movement and Attacking}

Move using number keys, vi keys, or arrow keys.  Attempting to move into a
creature's tile will either attack it, if the creature is hostile, or
else prompt for confirmation to attack, switch places, or squeeze past.
If carrying a digging implement, and trying to move into a diggable tile
(e.g. rock, earth), an attempt to dig will be made.

\subsection{The Bestiary and Item Codex}

The bestiary and item codex provide a way to get more information about the creatures and items you encounter in your journey.  The bestiary is a compendium of information on creatures throughout the world, providing a verbose description of every beast and person you might meet.

The item codex is used to get information on items.  These can be items held in your possession, but the codex can also be used to search for items you do not have - artifacts, weapons, armour, wands, and anything else you might find.  The item codex provides more information than the bestiary, showing resistances and enchantments, details specific to certain types of item (nutrition for food and potions, evade and soak for armour, charges for wands, and so on), and also provides a textual description of the item itself.
