DEFAULT_PLAYER_NAME=Wanderer
RACE_1_NAME=Human
RACE_1_SHORT_DESC=Versatile and resourceful
RACE_1_DESC=Humans live in the centre lands, and on the largest islands, making their homes in cities and settlements, outposts and camps.  They are short and tall, fair and dark, settled and nomadic, always adaptive, always resourceful, and always able to make the most of any situation.
RACE_1_ABRV=Hm
RACE_2_NAME=Wood Elf
RACE_2_SHORT_DESC=Wild forest rovers
RACE_2_DESC=Wood Elves retreated into the forests millennia ago, building their civilizations in the treetops and branches.  Within the woods, they blend in with their surroundings, their clothing dyed deep shades of green and brown.  Wood Elves are skilled archers, and are known for their devotion to swordsmanship.
RACE_2_ABRV=Wd
RACE_3_NAME=Mountain Elf
RACE_3_SHORT_DESC=Hardy dwellers of the frozen peaks
RACE_3_DESC=Mountain Elves live high up in the mountains, far above the rest of the world.  They are stockier than other elves, and even most humans, fortified by a life in the cold, thin air.  Mountain Elves typically wear animal skins, and craft weapons out of the tools at hand, making use of stone, animal bones, and the little wood at hand.  They are skilled with clubs, hammers, slings, and stones.
RACE_3_ABRV=Mt
RACE_4_NAME=Marsh Elf
RACE_4_SHORT_DESC=Cunning elves from the fens and wetlands
RACE_4_DESC=Marsh Elves left the forest and mountains to congregate within the marshes and swamps, building their settlements on patches of dry land, sometimes floating their homes on the marsh itself.  Their skin has a sickly, green hue, their hair made stringy by the toxic oils and gases.  They craft their weapons from the impure bog iron of their marshes, and are deadly with their barbed spears, either up close, or from a distance.
RACE_4_ABRV=Ma
RACE_5_NAME=Pixie
RACE_5_SHORT_DESC=Last remnants of the ancient fae
RACE_5_DESC=Pixies are tiny magical creatures, remnants of the so-called faerie folk that lived in the world far before the elves.  Able to fly, they constantly flit above the ground, their wings barely visible behind them.  They share the forest with the Wood Elves, living deep within the forests, where only the echo of their laughter can be heard.  Pixies are stealthy tricksters, and are tremendously skilled with magic.
RACE_5_ABRV=Px
RACE_6_NAME=Dwarf
RACE_6_SHORT_DESC=Strong and stout, from deep beneath the earth
RACE_6_DESC=Dwarves live deep within mountains, far below the naturally-occurring caverns and caves that serve as the entranceways.  They carve their cities from the rock itself, and mine the mountains for its ore.  They are short, about two-thirds the size of a human, but stocky, and disproportionately strong.  Dwarves are skilled with axes, hammers and crossbows
RACE_6_ABRV=Dw
RACE_7_NAME=Goblin
RACE_7_SHORT_DESC=Sly and quick
RACE_7_DESC=Goblins are short, cunning humanoids with sharp features and sharper teeth.  They live in small tribes on the outer islands, though recently they have been spotted closer and closer to the centre lands.   Despite their smaller size, they are ferocious creatures, afraid of nothing.  They wear ratty, tattered clothing, and are skilled with their sharp, curved blades.
RACE_7_ABRV=Gb
RACE_8_NAME=Gnoll
RACE_8_SHORT_DESC=Dog-like creatures, fierce and strong
RACE_8_DESC=Gnolls are dog-like creatures that stand taller than most men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures’ fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.  Fortunately for the gnolls, they make up for this with a tremendous strength and fortitude.  Gnolls are often seen wearing scraps of armour plundered from their kills, and prefer great axes and huge hammers above all else.
RACE_8_ABRV=Gn
RACE_9_NAME=Giant
RACE_9_SHORT_DESC=Descendents of those that waged war against the fae
RACE_9_DESC=Though they are often seen as creatures of chaos by the unfamiliar, Giants are as old as the pixies, and warred with the faerie folk when the world was still young.  Massive and tremendously strong, they stand twice as tall as the tallest man.  They live in the outer reaches of the world, where their settlements are constantly under attack by goblins and gnolls, whom they hate. Giants prefer large, stone clubs, though when these are unavailable, a small tree will often do.
RACE_9_ABRV=Gi
RACE_10_NAME=Ratling
RACE_10_SHORT_DESC=Magic-bent creatures of the caverns and caves
RACE_10_DESC=Ratlings live in caverns and caves, driven there hundreds of years ago by fearful settlers.  They stand just shorter than men, and their eyes tend to glow an unsettling red.  Their years spent in dark caves have made them all but immune to the strongest poisons, and they are skilled with knives and other short blades.
RACE_10_ABRV=Ra
