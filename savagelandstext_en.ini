RACE_4_SHORT_DESC=Snake-like men from the fens and wetlands
RACE_4_DESC=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.  The resultant creatures horrified the world: standing nearly as tall as a man, the creatures had the scales and head of an enormous snake, with the remaining features human in appearance.  Cast to the fringes of the world, the Snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.
RACE_4_ABRV=Sn
RACE_5_NAME=Fae
RACE_5_SHORT_DESC=Last remnants of the ancient fair folk
RACE_5_DESC=The Fae are the remnants of the so-called faerie folk that lived in the world far before the elves.

RACE_9_NAME=Giant
RACE_9_SHORT_DESC=Descendents of those that waged war against the fae
RACE_9_DESC=Though they are often seen as creatures of chaos by the unfamiliar, Giants are even older than the elves, and warred with the faerie folk when the world was still young.  Massive and tremendously strong, they stand twice as tall as the tallest man.  They live in the outer reaches of the world, where their settlements are constantly under attack by goblins and ogres, whom they hate. Giants prefer large, stone clubs, though when these are unavailable, a small tree will often do.

CLASS_13_NAME=Seafarer

CLASS_13_ABRV=Sa
CLASS_14_NAME=Shepherd
CLASS_14_DESC=Shepherds are among the weakest and most lowly in society.  Tending to their flocks, or those of others, they live at the fringes of civilization, ekeing out a living from the land.

THRALL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thrall
THRALL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thrall
THRALL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thrall stares at you with burning, lifeless eyes.
THRALL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Thralls are undead made from the fresh corpses of the recently fallen. They resemble their former selves, though the colour of the skin fades, becoming a sickly yellow to grey.  Lacking the coordination of the living, they move slowly, but lose none of their former strength.  Due to the ease of animation, they are popular slaves and guards to black wizards, often carrying large axes to great effect.
SPOOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spook
SPOOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spook
SPOOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A wispy, transparent patch of light, barely visible to the naked eye, the spook is a malevolent and mischievous spirit, often thought to be the remaining spirit of a child or half-wit.  Spooks crash about, creating a terrible noise.  They rampage through villages, breaking pots and pitchers, knocking clothes off lines, and harassing animals.  They rarely stay in one place long, causing brief havoc and then leaving before the residents can summon their wizard or priest.
SPOOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spook makes a terrible racket.
SKELETON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton
SKELETON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton
SKELETON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton fixes you with its soulless gaze.
SKELETON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skeletons are the bones of the dead infused with unholy magics to give them form once more.  The bones are weakly separated by magic.  Sudden movements cause the bounces to bounce and click, and combined with the scraps of armour buried with the dead, this lends skeletons a tell-tale clattering sound that serves to announce their presence.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal warrior
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal warrior's jaws clatter loudly.
SKELETAL_WARRIOR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Necromancy is only as good as the bodies it animates, and skeletal warriors are good bodies indeed.  The skeletal remains of warriors, soldiers, and mercenaries, the animation creates a skeleton that is cunning, quick, and absolutely lethal.  Skeletal warriors usually wear a few ill-fitting scraps of armour, their claw-like hands grasping a sword that remains as keen in death as it was in life.
MUMMY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mummy
MUMMY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mummy
MUMMY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mummy opens its mouth and you are assaulted by a thousand years of decay.
MUMMY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most things die, they are buried or burned, and their bodies return to the earth. Sometimes, though, the body can be preserved long after death, and then possessed by evil spirits who exert their will through the decaying form. These creatures are mummies, fearful things who shamble slowly but possess an incredible strength.
ARDU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ardu
ARDU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ardu's voice is a sickly rasp, his words of a language lost to time.
ARDU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A great warrior of a forgotten empire, Ardu was protector to a great line of kings until he was deeply wounded in battle.  After dying shortly thereafter, his spirit was captured by witch-magic, forced to forever protect the sanctity of the ancient tombs.

SHADE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shade
SHADE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shade releases an anguished scream.
SHADE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of the recent dead, shades are the corporeal shadows of corpses, imbued with unholy life.  Shades roughly resemble the person they once were, but with formless features.  Their eyes are a milky white, their skin soft and black, with a velvet-like texture.  The touch of shades is much feared: full of the essence of shadow and darkness, it can cause the petrification and slow death of its victims, leaving behind a stiff, almost statue-like corpse.
LICH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lich
LICH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lich
LICH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lich murmurs, "Ic com on thisse blaec daeg for eower lif."
LICH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The lich is a fearsome creature, born from fusing black magic into the body of a great sorceror.  Years of death waste away the muscle tissue so that the skin stretches taught over nothing but bone.  And these years of unlife and study render the lich capable of unleashing terrible magics.  Cloaked in the tattered robes it wore in life, the lich's gaze is unmistakable, two embers burning beneath the shadow of the cowl.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeletal dragon
SKELETAL_DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal dragon rears back its head and releases a silent roar.
SKELETAL_DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To create a skeleton requires effort and concentration, for the will of the creature must be battled and overcome when unlife fills the body.  Because of this, few sorcerors attempt to reanimate the bones of a dragon.  Those that try usually end up crushed immediately by the dragon's tail, or impaled on the razor-teeth of its maw.  It is said that the great spellbinders of a previous age kept skeletal dragons as a sign of their personal power, the names of these wizards found carved on runic tablets deep in caves: Pelle, Falamar, and Wealhwin.
REAPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=reaper
REAPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a reaper
REAPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The reaper's empty expression seems fixed on you.
REAPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Agents of death and the afterlife, reapers are sad creatures forced to cull the marked living for all eternity.  Black-cloaked and wraith-like, reapers carry massive, wicked scythes which they use to end the lives of the living and send their souls to the world below.
RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rat
RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rat
RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small, long-tailed rodent with fur ranging from black to brown to grey, rats are ubiquitous in all parts of the world.  It is thought that they originated in the great central lands, and then made their way from island to island either by swimming or ship, depending on the distance.  A tiny, frail creature, the rat is nonetheless known to attack when hungry, capable of dealing some damage using its sharp teeth.
RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rat squeaks.
MOLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mole
MOLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mole
MOLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small subterranean mammals, moles are blinded by their habitat, unable to see at all.

MOLE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mole squeaks at you.
GHOST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghost
GHOST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghost
GHOST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Spirits of the once-living, ghosts are caught in a land of eternal twilight, never living, never dead.  It is said that they are forced by fate to roam the earth, shackled between worlds due to unsettled business.  They often appear near where they once lived, unnerving the living, frightening pets and livestock.  Ghosts tend to look much the same as their former selves, but transparent, and untroubled by walls and doors.
GHOST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghost's face becomes pure grief, pure sorrow.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral knight
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When most great warriors pass, they are surrounded by family and friends, sent off to the afterlife by those they loved most in life.  But there are some who do not make it so far.  Every warrior carries with himself the ones he killed; those without anyone to help shoulder the burden in life become transformed in death, taking spectral form.  From within the armour, their eyes burn endlessly, still haunted, still trapped, unable to find peace.
SPECTRAL_KNIGHT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=From beneath its visor, the spectral knight stares at you, its ghostly eyes a pair of burning coals.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral wizard
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wizards spend their lives in study, researching magics known and unknown.  During their studies and travels, some will commune with elemental and demonic creatures.  The most greedy, the most eager for fame will trade their soul for powerful magics, and that debt is always collected.  After the wizard dies, his spirit is shackled to the earth, bound by his word to walk until the world's end.  But though the body rots, the mind remains sharp, and spectral wizards will unleash torrential magics on those unfortunate enough to interrupt their travels.
SPECTRAL_WIZARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral wizard murmurs something in an ancient tongue.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral lord
SPECTRAL_LORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The unsettled spirits of ancient lords and ladies, spectral lords are powerful apparitions caught between the worlds.  Long after the body wastes away and becomes absorbed by the earth, spectral lords walk the heaths and fens, the reign of their houses long past.  They remain dressed in their death-clothes, and carry blades imbued with powerful magics, given to them in death to carry to the next life.
SPECTRAL_LORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral lord says nothing, its mouth open in a voiceless scream.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a spectral emperor
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=There have been a number of recorded empires throughout history, and others lost to time.  At the head of each is an emperor, or less often, an empress.  Each are sent to the afterlife with a lavish array of gifts: gold and silver, beautiful weapons and armour, even their favoured guards, family, and pets.  But sometimes this is not enough, and the spirit persists.  Spectral emperors roam far beyond the life of their empires, watching the rise and fall of many peoples, watching the mountains grow and shrink, never happy, never able to slip the earth and ascend into the world beyond.
SPECTRAL_EMPEROR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The spectral emperor stares through you.
CORPSE_RAT_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse rat
CORPSE_RAT_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The corpse rat is a large subspecies of the common rat, typically growing to three times the size.

CORPSE_RAT_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse rat squeaks.
GREEN_SLIME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=green slime
GREEN_SLIME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a green slime
GREEN_SLIME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A creature of some ancient magic, green slimes are largely inert, but will attack creatures that approach.  If successful, the slime will envelop the creature within itself, slowly dissolving its prey while slowing the natural rotting process.  Depending on the size of the creature, this may keep the slime fed for weeks, or even months.
IMP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=imp
IMP_DESCRIPTION_SID=an imp
IMP_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Imps are small, magical creatures, barely two feet in height.  Vaguely human in appearance, they are nonetheless very ugly, with squat, twisted features.  Descended from some common ancestor as the fae, they share a common wilfulness and sense of mischief.  They are thought to live deep underground, in caverns accessible only through the trunks of rotted trees.  When provoked, they attack with slim, stone-bladed knives.
IMP_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The imp chitters incomprehensively.
GOBLIN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin
GOBLIN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin
GOBLIN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are short, cunning humanoids with sharp features and sharper teeth.  They live in small tribes on the outer islands, though recently they have been spotted closer and closer to the centre lands.   Despite their smaller size, they are ferocious creatures, afraid of nothing.  They wear ratty, tattered clothing, and are skilled with their sharp, curved blades.
GOBLIN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin chuckles, "You would make a fine stew, I think!"
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin champion
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins often form raiding parties, sailing out on small boats to loot settlements and slake their thirst for blood.  Owing to their small size, a number never return.  But over time, the veterans of these campaigns grow stronger, and more cunning.  Clad in the best armour, wielding the finest swords, these champions become the leaders of their comrades and are known to be formidable foes.
GOBLIN_CHAMPION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin champion cackles mercilessly.
MINOTAUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=minotaur
MINOTAUR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a minotaur
MINOTAUR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Minotaurs are the combination of bull and man.  Standing near seven feet tall, minotaurs have the bodies of huge, powerful men, with the head of a great bull.  They attack with their huge skulls, smashing and goring their foes.  They live deep underground in the darkest caverns.  At night, they stomp and roar, the sounds echoing up through the rock to the world above.
MINOTAUR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The minotaur bellows in rage.
HYDRA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hydra
HYDRA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hydra
HYDRA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A many-headed serpent steeped in myth, hydras typically live in swamps and wetlands.  They are also known to live in any caves and caverns with a sufficient amount of water to sustain them.

NIGHTMARE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=nightmare
NIGHTMARE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a nightmare
NIGHTMARE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A coal-coloured mare from the depths of the underworld, the nightmare appears as from a terrifying dream.  Its eyes are bright red, and burn like small embers.

Many people believe that nightmares are forerunners, and that those who see them will die soon after.
NIGHTMARE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The nightmare shrieks.

SELLSWORD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sellsword
SELLSWORD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The sellsword is a skilled swordsman with few loyalties.  His services are available to the highest bidder, and can change as quickly as new bid is received.  Sellswords are not rich men, making enough to scrape by.  They tend to wear scraps of leather and mail: enough to protect some key areas, but not enough to hinder their movement.  But if their armour is suspect, their weapon is not.  Their swords are always well-made and well-tended, sharpened daily, and always ready for use.
SELLSWORD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sellsword says, "It's nothing personal, adventurer, but I will kill you."

UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A fabled animal of purity, the unicorn is a white mare with a spiral horn in the centre of its head.  It lives in the deep woodlands and fields, far from civilization.

UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The unicorn whinnies.
BLACK_UNICORN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a black unicorn
BLACK_UNICORN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The counter-balance to the unicorn, the black unicorn is a creature of shadow and darkness.  Lacking the horn of its white counterpart, the black unicorn instead has a non-functional pair of wings.  It is for this reason that it is sometimes known as a "black pegasus".  Black unicorns are greatly feared for their aggressiveness, attacking with pure chaos and entropy, dissipating into shadow when finally slain.
BLACK_UNICORN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black unicorn whinnies.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goblin raider
GOBLIN_RAIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Goblins are inherently war-like, and many become raiders, creating war-parties that sail to distant shores to pillage settlements and pilfer gold.  Goblin raiders are the members of these crews.  They carry long spears, and wear bits of armour taken from the dead.  As well, they have a gruesome custom of removing the heads and arms of their victims.  The raiders line the masts of their ships with the skulls, and tie the arm-bones near the heads of their spears, creating an ugly clacking sound.
GOBLIN_RAIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goblin raider laughs, "Your head would look good on my pike!"
GOLEM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=golem

MAMMOTH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mammoth
MAMMOTH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The mammoth is an enormous, elephantine mammal with shaggy fur that ranges from tan to black.  They are heard even before they are seen, for their stamping shakes the earth, and their trunks bellow and blare louder than a trumpet.  Though they are far from extinct, their numbers are less than in the past, for the ivory from their tusks is considered the greatest and purest, and is widely sought.
MAMMOTH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A mammoth bellows.
SKELETON_KING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skeleton king
SKELETON_KING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When the bodies of mere mortals are fused with dark magics, they produce skeletons; when the body of a great warrior or king is treated the same, the result is the horrifying skeleton king.  Resembling a normal skeleton but garbed in robes or armour, skeleton kings' status in life becomes its power in death.  They are frighteningly quick.  Rather than shamble, they run at a full sprint, sword drawn, ready to make short work of all that stand in their way.
SKELETON_KING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeleton king laughs silently, and its jaws click and clatter.

ARCHANGEL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The highest of the celestial beings, archangels are the devout servants of the Nine, ready to help their servants and smite their foes.

TROGLODYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troglodyte
TROGLODYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Distant cousins of man, troglodytes are short humanoids who dwell deep in caves and mountains, almost as deep as dwarves.

TROGLODYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A troglodyte spits a few words of a low, guttural tongue.
TROLL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=troll
TROLL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a troll
TROLL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Trolls live at the fringes of civilization: in caves and caverns, deep in swamps, under bridges.  They are the enormous and dim-witted kin of ogres, very distantly related.  Warty, filthy, and stupid, they make up for their shortcomings with immense strength.  They rip apart their prey with their bare hands, feasting on flesh and marrow, leaving the broken bones scattered around their lairs like so much debris.
TROLL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The troll rears its head back and roars.
BEHOLDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=beholder
BEHOLDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a beholder
BEHOLDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Rising from the depths of the underworld, beholders levitate by magical force, hovering several feet above the ground.

TENTACLED_HORROR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a tentacled horror

DRAGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=dragon
DRAGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a dragon
DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mightiest of beasts, the dragon is a massive serpent capable of walking on four legs, or flying high into the heavens on its wings.  Dragons are wicked as they are strong, and greedy.  They love gold and gems, which they hoard within their lairs, high atop mountains or deep beneath the earth.  Their scales shimmer and are known to come in a range of colours, from dull greens to dark reds, silver, black, and blue.  All dragons are fire-breathers.  Their breath is death to the unwary, hot enough to melt steel and shatter bone.
DRAGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The dragon unleashes a roar that shakes the earth.
SYLPH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=sylph
SYLPH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a sylph
SYLPH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tiny air spirits, sylphs dance on the winds and currents of air, so quick as to be barely visible.  They resemble tiny, beautiful women, merry and capricious.  On their backs are delicate wings, which seem almost still as they move.  They charge the air as they dance and dive; if many sylphs gather together, then the result is surely storms.
SYLPH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The sylph laughs, and her laughter carries on the sudden wind.
NAIAD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=naiad
NAIAD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a naiad
NAIAD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=When Vedere made the lakes and rivers, he made the naiads to watch over them.  Naiads are water spirits, moving through currents and under still waters.  When they appear before men, they take the form of impossibly beautiful women, long-haired and naked.  They speak some sort of ethereal language, their words sung sweet as music.  A naiad's beauty has charmed many to follow them into the water.  Many have drowned.  Those that survive talk of a delerium, sinking below the waves in a naiad's embrace, before breaking free of the spell, and surfacing.
NAIAD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The naiad asks, "Won't you come join me in the river?"
HARPY_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=harpy
HARPY_DESCRIPTION_SID=a harpy
HARPY_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A strange cross between woman and bird, the harpy lives far from civilization, terrorizing those misfortunate enough to cross her path.  Harpies have the torso and head of a woman.  Rather than arms, they possess huge wings, and a bird's taloned feet.  They possess little beauty, their faces having sharp features: grim mouths, sharp noses, narrow eyes.  They are unfriendly and ill-tempered, and think little of swooping in to attack unwary adventurers.
HARPY_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The harpy shrieks.
VAMPIRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=vampire
VAMPIRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a vampire
VAMPIRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Masters of the night, vampires are undead lords who feast on the blood of the living.  Having made pacts with dark powers, vampires use their blood magic to hover silently, transform into creatures such as bats and rats, and charm the living with illusion and glamour.

COLOSSUS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=colossus
COLOSSUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a colossus
COLOSSUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Statues imbued with magical life-force, colossi can stand more than a hundred feet high.  They are painstakingly carved by master sculptors from a single block of marble or stone, before a sorceror performs the rites to animate the creation.

WYVERN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyvern
WYVERN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyvern
WYVERN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Huge reptiles with features of both wyrms and dragons, wyverns are massive creatures that figure prominently in legend and myth.  They can stand on their two hind legs, but lack the two front legs of dragons; and, like dragons, they can take to the sky on their massive wings.  Wyverns lack the intelligence of their reptilian cousins, however, owning only the low intelligence of lizards and snakes.  They do not want for ferocity, and use their massive teeth and talons to tear apart the unwary.
WYVERN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyvern screeches.
SKRAELING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=skraeling
SKRAELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a skraeling
SKRAELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skraelings are a tribe of men who live far to the north and south.

BARROW_SPIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a barrow spider
BARROW_SPIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Green-black arachnids that nest near the barrows of the newly dead, barrow spiders are smaller than an ivory piece but possess a concentrated venom capable of killing creatures many times their size.

Among the most cunning and fiendish are the deep wizards, a race of creatures that cloak themselves in dwarfskin, and commune with ancient spirits.

Their flesh is inky black, and appears hazy in the low light.  Their eyes are the most startling, glowing bright, ranging from red to gold to green.  The voices of deep wizards are little more than a low whisper, murmuring incantations to unleash hell upon the world.

It is for this reason that shadow snakes are known in some areas as "stone snakes", and hunted ruthlessly.
SHADOW_SNAKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow snake hisses.
SHADOW_BEAST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow beast
SHADOW_BEAST_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow beast

SHADOW_WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shadow wyrm
SHADOW_WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wyrms live deep beneath the earth, where they make their lairs in ancient cracks and crevices.  But sometimes, they delve too far, snaking through passageways to a place where ancient magic still sleeps.  Those that do become infused with the magical taint, and grow frighteningly powerful.  Their scales darken; their breath becomes wisps of chaos and darkness.  The wyrms sit on their great hoards, repeating ancient incantations and carving forgotten runes into the chambers and corridors.  In the eternal night of the under-lands, even their minds darken, corrupted more and more until eventually, the wyrm becomes little more than an automaton, controlled by the ancient magic it once discovered.
SHADOW_WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shadow wyrm hisses, "Who are you, who disturbs my slumber?"

SNAKELING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a snakeling
SNAKELING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Many thousands of years ago, a sorceror used black magic to fuse man and serpent, twisting his apprentices into demonic, snake-like forms.

Cast to the fringes of the world, the Snakelings banded together in fens and marshes, hunting under darkness with barbed spears and javelins, the generations of isolation filling their minds with a black and heavy hate.

REDCAP_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=redcap
REDCAP_DESCRIPTION_SID=a redcap

Their clothes are barely better than rags, and they carry little stone blades in their hands.  Their teeth are long and sharp.  Owing to this, their mouths are a mess of blood and gore, and the trail of a redcap is easily found.

PEGASUS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a pegasus
PEGASUS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A semi-mythical creature that figures prominently in much ancient poetry, the pegasus is a white, winged horse capable of carrying its rider to the heavens.

BOG_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=bog devil
BOG_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a bog devil

KESTREL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The kestrel shrieks!
ROOK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rook
ROOK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rook
ROOK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rook belongs to the same family of birds as crows and ravens, and its distinguished from its cousins by the white of its beak.  A social bird, rooks typically hunt and nest in groups, and are quick to defend any companions that may be threatened.
ROOK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rook caws.
SHRIKE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=shrike
SHRIKE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a shrike
SHRIKE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Shrikes are a predatory bird, small, but dangerous.  They are fond of grasping their victims in their talons and impaling it on whatever they can find: brambles, sharp branches, and nearby rocks being the most common.  When their victim is too large to be moved, the shrike will instead attack ferociously, diving in and out quickly, attempting to bleed out its victim before feeding on the carcass.
SHRIKE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The shrike chirps.
FALCON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=falcon
FALCON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a falcon
FALCON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Falcons are large hunting birds, intelligent raptors that typically feed on small mammals.  Falcons have also shown a trainability that has long made them a favourite among the nobility, who enjoy them as a symbol of status and wealth, and train them to hunt upon command.
FALCON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The falcon shrieks!
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf
MOUNTAIN_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Mountain Elves live high up in the mountains, far above the rest of the world.  They are stockier than other elves, and even most humans, fortified by a life in the cold, thin air.  Mountain Elves typically wear animal skins, and craft weapons out of the tools at hand, making use of stone, animal bones, and the little wood at hand.  They are skilled with clubs, hammers, slings, and stones.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf nods at you.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a mountain elf explorer
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Elves share a common curiosity.  Wood elves enjoy crafting, the fae practice elder magics, and the mountain elves satisfy their curiosity through exploration.  Their villages are built into mountains, but still low enough that there is plenty of air.  Mountain elf explorers dress in fur coats made from bear and sheep, and climb the highest peaks, carving their names as they reach the summits.  They are extremely able climbers, climbing with little equipment save for a tent, sleeping roll, and a few other necessities.
MOUNTAIN_ELF_EXPLORER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The mountain elf explorer exclaims, "Watch your step!"
WOOD_ELF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf
WOOD_ELF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf
WOOD_ELF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood Elves retreated into the forests millennia ago, building their civilizations in the treetops and branches.  Within the woods, they blend in with their surroundings, their clothing dyed deep shades of green and brown.  Wood Elves are skilled archers, and are known for their devotion to swordsmanship.
WOOD_ELF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf says, "It is a beautiful day, is it not?"
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf swordsman
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Wood elves do not have the ready access to ore that other races, such as dwarves, gnomes, or even humans do.  They set up small mines, and when they do find deposits, guard them carefully.  With the ore, they create swords of incredible function and beauty.  Some elves, captivated by this beauty, dedicate their lives to swordsmanship, carrying little more than a blade and the clothes on their back.  These swordsman are revered by the elves, and feared by outsiders, for they form the small and elite core of the elven armies.
WOOD_ELF_SWORDSMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf swordsman looks at you distrustfully.
ILRU_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_DESCRIPTION_SID=Ilru
ILRU_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Leader of the Yew Wood Elves, Ilru has seen hundreds of summers pass in the old forest.  A proud man entering into old age, Ilru's long red hair is streaked with grey, his face testament to his years.  He wears a rough green shirt and a leather cape, and tucks a simple knife into his belt.
ILRU_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Ilru nods at you.  "Welcome, traveller.  This is the Forest of Yew."
FALIR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Falir
FALIR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A young wood-elf dressed in a loose grey robe, Falir looks much older than his years.  His voice has withered to a whisper; he walks slowly, with purpose; and an ugly purple scar runs from his forehead down to his ear.  His green eyes are cat-like and piercing in the low light.  Falir clutches a twisted wooden staff between his hands.
FALIR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Falir speaks in a soft tone.  "You have done well to find us here.  This forest is very deep and deceptive."
LALO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Lalo
LALO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Clad in fine armour beneath a dark green cloak, clutching a glowing white spear, Lalo watches keenly from beneath his cowl.  A wood elf with dark red hair and nut-brown skin, Lalo's face is harsh and pale.  His eyes are steel-grey and unblinking, and his lips form a thin frown; his veins bulge against impossibly thin skin.  Underneath the fine mail, Lalo's movements are quick and precise, and his voice conveys a keen intelligence and authority.
LALO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Lalo murmurs, "You will make a suitable slave in the next life."
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wood elf sage
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Perhaps owing to their long life and natural curiosity, wood elves with a talent for magic rarely limit themselves to a single subject.  Equally capable as wizards, oracles, and pilgrims, many choose the long road of the sage, spending many years acquiring a broad depth of knowledge.  They spend their days inside, reading.  Their nights are spent in candlelight, hunched over ancient texts and in prayer to the Nine.  They are much frailer in appearance than other elves, taking little food and wine, and often are particularly gaunt in appearance.
WOOD_ELF_SAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wood elf sage says, "Knowledge is geography - it must be charted for future generations."
LICHLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lichling
LICHLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lichling
LICHLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Sages speak of black sorceries practiced long ago, magics that could raise the dead from their rest.  Some students have tried to study this magic.  Most become mad, wandering the world, speaking of black devils, sea-demons, tendrils in the night.  But some, a few, are able to force their way into this realm.  These magi become filled with unnatural powers, able to command the darkness and foul creatures, able to fell the living and raise the dead with but a word.  The initiates are called lichlings, and live somewhere between life and death.  Gaunt and grey, their flesh festers with open sores, and their teeth are full of rot.  Their hair takes on a putrid brown-grey appearance, and their movements become slow and arthritic.  But beneath their robes, their eyes burn, their minds becoming slowly corrupted by the powers they unlocked.
LICHLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lichling hisses, and you can smell decay in its breath.
GREY_GLIDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a grey glider
GREY_GLIDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The grey gliders are the recently dead who have been infused with spells of life and lifting.  The magic drains all colour from them: from their skin, their death shrouds, and any possessions.  This process makes them a startling dark grey in appearance.  As well, grey gliders do not walk.  Their magic grants them the ability to glide inches above the ground, allowing them to silently stalk their victims before delivering the fatal bite with their sharpened teeth.
GREY_GLIDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The grey glider's lips twist back into an ugly smile.
GHOUL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ghoul
GHOUL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a ghoul
GHOUL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ghouls are animated corpses.  Raised by more powerful magic than the thrall, ghouls are quick and nimble, much faster than they appear.  Instead of fingers, they have talon-like claws, and unlike the thrall, ghouls are nearly silent.  The black magic robs them of their voices.  They are often seen with their mouths open in a silent scream, the only sound being a slow, quiet hiss.
GHOUL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ghoul releases a hiss of fetid air.
CORPSE_BIRD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a corpse bird
CORPSE_BIRD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Corpse birds come from the same family as crows and ravens.  They are smaller than crows, though their talons are larger, and their beaks longer.  Their eyes have a strange red rim about them.  Though corpse birds are social, and often seen in groups, it is when they are seen alone that people are most troubled.  Many have passed down stories in which the sudden appearance of a corpse bird, and its cackle-like laugh, have foreshadowed a sudden death.
CORPSE_BIRD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The corpse bird caws.
QUISLING_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=quisling
QUISLING_DESCRIPTION_SID=a quisling
QUISLING_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Treacherous, lesser demons from the underworld, quislings superficially resemble men and women.  On closer inspection, they have two key differences: they have a ram's legs rather than a humands, and nubby horns at the edge of their forehead.  To hide their appearance and walk among men, they wrap themselves in long, hooded cloaks.  They do not wear boots, however, and the sign of hooves or the tell-tale sound they make is quick to betray them.  Quislings speak in soft, assuring tones, purporting to help people before turning on them in a vicious rage to drag their souls into the world below.
QUISLING_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The quisling smiles, "I see a great future for you, adventurer.  A glittering career."
COUGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cougar
COUGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cougar
COUGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large breed of cat, the cougar is smaller than other cats such as the tiger or lion, but larger than the lynx.  Cougars are wide-spread, living in forests, grasslands, and mountains.  Cougars feed on whatever mammals they can find: rabbit, fox, deer, even wild horses and rams.  Their fur ranges from light to dark brown, and a full-grown adult can grow to be more than two hundred pounds.  Cougars are known to be aggressive towards people, particularly when hungry.
COUGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cougar emits a strange sound, somewhere between a whine and growl.
LION_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lion
LION_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lion
LION_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Among the largest of the great cats, lions prowl the grasslands and savannahs, the prey of no beast.  Lions live in groups called prides, and hunt the great roaming herds of large mammals, culling the young, the sick, and the elderly.  Growing to hundreds of pounds, lions' claws are capable of slicing through small trees, their massive jaws capable of biting through mail.  Lions are a symbol of power and strength, and figure prominently in the heraldry of the royal houses.
LION_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lion roars.
CAVE_TIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cave tiger
CAVE_TIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The largest member of the cat family, cave tigers prowl the caves and caverns of the mountainsides, occasionally coming down to the fields and forests when times are lean.  Usually a foot higher than a lion, and several feet longer, cave tigers' colouring matches their natural habitat.  Their fur is a sandy brown, offering a degree of camouflage in mountain settings.  Perhaps their most startling feature is their jaws: two massive fangs extend from their upper jaw beyond the lower, providing them a terrifying way with which to gore, main, and kill their prey.
CAVE_TIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cave tiger roars.
LIGER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=liger
LIGER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a liger
LIGER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A hybrid of lion and tiger, bred for its ability with magic, the liger closely resembles a lion with a tiger's colouring.  Something in the breeding process centuries ago awoke something: a low sentience, perhaps, and one that was strangely attuned to the primordial energies of the world.  As a result, ligers attack with the ferocity of a beast, but with the arcane energies of a sorceror.  Ligers are greatly prized among wizards; if tamed, the beasts are considered among the greatest of familiars.
LIGER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The liger whines, a high-pitched, siren-like sound.
GOLIATH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=goliath
GOLIATH_DESCRIPTION_SID=a goliath
GOLIATH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Towering above the cyclopes, the colossi, and even the heavenly titans, the goliaths are massive creatures from before recorded time.  They sleep underneath mountains, deep in caverns - anywhere where they can find rest.  It is said they were among the first creations on the world, and it was through their footsteps that the world took shape.  Goliaths are so tall that they can into the heavens to throw lightning, smiting their foes before retreating back to their rest.
GOLIATH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The goliath's speech rumbles like thunder in a long-forgotten tongue.
DEMOGORGON_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_DESCRIPTION_SID=a demogorgon
DEMOGORGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Demogorgons are primordial spirits, immortal and incredibly powerful.  They travel at will not just through the world, but through time and space as well.  Many a man has been seduced by the supposed secrets whispered in his ear by these ancient creatures, told of ancient magics and future discoveries, driven mad by the unrealizable torrent of knowledge.  When demogorgons take physical form, they appear as massive, multi-headed beasts, each head whispering truths and falsehoods.  As they are immortal, they cannot be killed; when their physical form perishes, it releases the spirit, which travels away before reforming again.
DEMOGORGON_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The demogorgon's voice echoes soundlessly in your head.
BLOOD_HAWK_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blood hawk
BLOOD_HAWK_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blood hawk
BLOOD_HAWK_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, savage bird, the blood hawk is so named for the appearance of its large talons after killing its prey.  While other birds tend to attack with the beak, the blood hawk is notable for its reliance upon its talons.  The blood hawk is also notable for its fearlessness, aggressively asserting itself within its domain, unafraid of any challenger.
BLOOD_HAWK_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blood hawk shrieks!
ROC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=roc
ROC_DESCRIPTION_SID=the roc
ROC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A beast of myth and legend, the roc is said to have a wingspan to blot out the sun, with feathers of fire and silver and gold.  The few reported sightings tend to be shipwrecked sailors, who claim the great bird capable of rending a ship like paper, leaving them to their doom.  There have been no sightings among the civilized peoples of the world, and as such, the roc remains a story in the eyes of most.
ROC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The roc emits a deafening shriek!
SATYR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=satyr
SATYR_DESCRIPTION_SID=a satyr
SATYR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Creatures of legend and myth, satyrs combine the features of goats and men.  They have the upper body of a man, save for a small pair of goat's horns; their legs are those of a goat, and they have short tails as well.  Satyrs are often heard before they are seen.  Musical creatures, they love the sound of their reed flutes and pipes, which they carry with them everywhere. 
SATYR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The satyr grins at you, and plays its pipes.
BLACK_MANTICORE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=black manticore
BLACK_MANTICORE_DESCRIPTION_SID=the black manticore
BLACK_MANTICORE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The black manticore is a huge beast that resembles a lion, but has a human head with cold, green eyes.  Its fur is short and hard, shiny, and black as charcoal.  An intelligent creature, the black manticore can speak many tongues, able to switch between elven and dwarven, gnomish and the many languages of man.  Its voice is light and airy.  Survivors have told of its timbre resembling pan pipes whistling in the wind.
BLACK_MANTICORE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The black manticore chimes, "You are not welcome here.  Say what prayers you will."
ARMOURED_BEETLE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an armoured beetle
ARMOURED_BEETLE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large insect with a hard, almost metallic shell, the armoured beetle takes its name from its carapace.  Feeding on grubs and small vertebrates, the armoured beetle lives deep underground, making its home within the soils and caverns of the world.
ROCK_ADDER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a rock adder
ROCK_ADDER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The rock adder hisses slowly.
ROCK_ADDER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The rock adder is a venomous snake that lives in crevices and cracks, out of the sunlight.  It feasts on small mammals and large insects, and has a particularly potent bite.  Its name is taken from its dull brown-grey colour, which allows it to remain hidden in the rocks and earth.
ACOLYTE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=acolyte
ACOLYTE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an acolyte
ACOLYTE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The acolyte murmurs, "Praise be."
ACOLYTE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Novices of their faiths, acolytes exist for all of the Nine.  They tend to the worship sites, help priests with their tasks, and spend long hours studying holy books.  They typically leave their homes at a young age.  Some take up residence in towns and villages, while others follow the call to the far ends of the world.  Regardless of the route they take, acolytes spend many years in service before becoming blessed priests.
FOX_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fox
FOX_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fox
FOX_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A small mammal, the common red fox is a carnivore that feeds on rabbits, mice, and other such creatures.  Known for their stealth and cunning, foxes prefer to avoid the company of people, who have been known to hunt and eat the creature when food becomes scarce.
FOX_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fox yips.
CHRISTOF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_DESCRIPTION_SID=Christof
CHRISTOF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large, barrel-chested gnome, Christof is the elected leader of the Gnordvar gnomes, bearing the title of "Chancellor".  Beneath his surcoat he wears a shirt of fine, gnomish mail, and a jewelled short sword hangs from his waist.  Many years ago, during a goblin raid, Christof repelled the invaders with a small band of his kinfolk, catching the goblins in a narrow mountain trail.  The gnomes destroyed all but a single goblin, sending it back to spread the tale.  Gnordvar has had little trouble with sea-raiders since.
CHRISTOF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Christof exclaims, "Visitors!  How delightful!"
ELFRIC_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_DESCRIPTION_SID=Elfric
ELFRIC_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small, even for a gnome, and very frail, Elfric looks caught somewhere between middle- and old-age.  His beard is long, and unkempt, streaked with grey as well as leaves and twigs.  He wears a tattered, red robe.  Within it, he keeps all manner of powders, metals, and herbs, the base ingredients of his alchemy.
ELFRIC_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Elfric whispers, "I require magnesium ore for my flash-powders, but the mines are so dangerous and full of beasts!"
ALFREDO_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_DESCRIPTION_SID=Alfredo
ALFREDO_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Tall and slender, an adventurer by trade, Alfredo carries his world on his back.  A large leather backpack has been stuffed with clothes and rations, a sleeping roll, and a small tent.  A small stabbing sword hangs from his belt.  His skin is tanned a deep nut-brown by the sun, and his bright eyes twinkle as he talks, mirroring an unconscious half-smile.
ALFREDO_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Alfredo grimaces. "The mines have been overrun! Christof sent me to investigate, but what lurks there is too strong for me!"
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish barkeeper
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_DESCRIPTION_SID=the gnomish barkeeper
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Smartly dressed in a leather apron and a crisp, pressed shirt, his hair neatly oiled and parted, the gnomish barkeeper provides welcome relief to the miners of Gnordvar.  He serves up ale, stout, and whisky from huge barrels behind the bar, always appreciative when patrons tip a little extra.
GNOMISH_BARKEEPER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish barkeeper queries, "Will you have whisky, or beer?"
GNOME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnome
GNOME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnome
GNOME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.  They are intelligent and quick; gnomes love riddles and puzzles, and have a deep affinity for magic.  In combat, they show skill with knives and other short blades.
GNOME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnome says, "The underground's getting rather dangerous lately.  Wonder what it is?"
GNOMISH_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a foot and a half high, the gnomish child's clothes are torn and stained, its hair a mess of leaves and dirt.  The child has either lost or abandoned its shoes, and its feet are tanned the same deep brown as the rest of it.  Its pockets look to be teeming: with bugs and worms, shiny stones, and anything else that has captured its attention, however briefly.
GNOMISH_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish child stares at you with huge eyes. "Can I have some candy?"
GNOMISH_MINER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Delving deep beneath the earth, hauling ore and gems to the surface, the gnomish miner lives a life in near darkness.  Caked with coal-dust, sweat, and grime, his skin has taken on a greyish hue.  His eyes narrow, squinting, his vision decimated by a life spent underground.  But despite these maladies, with thick, heavy arms, and a broad chest, the gnome looks more like a dwarf, stocky and powerful.
GNOMISH_MINER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish miner says, "My father was a peat-cutter, and I have no spade to follow him.  But I've got my pick; I'll dig with that."

GNORDVAR_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall man, towering over the gnomes he serves, Theodoric built and maintains the small stone temple in Gnordvar.  After studying as an acolyte in the inner isles, Theodoric was granted a boat and told to make harbour wherever he was needed.  He sailed east, and arrived in Gnordvar a dozen years ago.  With the blessing of its people, he built a temple for the village, and now leads a simple life of prayer and healing among the smallest people of the world.

LIGHTNING_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lightning bug

FROST_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small creatures of cold and ice, frost devils travel on freezing winds, culling the sick and infirm, the very young, the dying.  Barely a foot high, they resemble tiny children.  Their skin has a white-grey hue, and their eyes are a bright, startling blue.  They are ferocious.  Knowing no fear, they attack creatures many times their size, slowing them with a bite of terrible, numbing cold.
FROST_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frost devil screams, and a cold wind surrounds you.
FIRE_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of an older time, fire devils live deep within the earth, far past the homes dug by the dwarves and gnomes, with whom they war constantly.  Beings of intense mischief, fire devils arise from cracks and canyons to wreak havoc on living things, igniting with their touch and leaving little but cinders and char, their high-pitched laughs echoing behind.
FIRE_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire devil cackles, and its flames flicker and dance.
AMAUROSIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient wyrm, the last of his kind, Amaurosis lives deep within the caverns of the barren northwest isle.  His body is impossibly long; his mind is even more cunning.  Born of chaotic magics as the world just began, he ravaged the peoples of the world twice in recorded history, finally sealed back by the great warlocks of old.  But as their numbers dwindled, so too did his seal, and it is said that thunder and smoke fill the air once more.
AMAUROSIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient wyrm emits a piercing shriek, causing the caverns to rumble.
FISHERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fisherman
FISHERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fisherman
FISHERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Where there are lakes, rivers, and oceans, there are fisherman: simple, honest folk who feed their families and peoples through the bounty of the waters.  They travel in coracles and skiffs, dromonds and longboats, alone or in teams, fishing with line, nets, and spears.  Salt fish is a common winter staple among many people, who rely on stores of it to see them through to spring.
FISHERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fisherman says, "Good fishing, today."
SEAWIFE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seawife
SEAWIFE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seawife
SEAWIFE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Fishermen are married to the open water, but those that take wives must leave them regularly in search of their catch. The seawives tend to the home in the absence of their husbands; they mend clothes and nets, raise the children, and salt the last trip's fish.

THE_PLOUGHMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A smug, simpering creature, the ploughman brags and boasts of his importance within society.  Immortalized by the colloquy of a certain monk, he is less appreciated by his fellow villagers, who see the man as useful, but still an insufferable git.

THE_BLACKSMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=the blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Due to the recent publication of a colloquy on the occupations, the blacksmith's prominent place in society is suddenly under attack.  Formerly lionized for his skills, for crafting weapons of war and implements of peace alike, for smithing spears and shoeing horses, the blacksmith now must fight for respect after a particular monk declared that "the ploughman feeds us all."
THE_BLACKSMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blacksmith scoffs, "That miserable, braggart ploughman!  Who hews his hoe?  Who smelts his steel?"

VILLAGE_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste, maintains a small church within the village of Isen Dun, leading nightly prayers and tending to the sick and wounded.

CYNWISE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An older, childless woman, Cynwise lives at the fringes of Isen Dun.  One of the few villagers with any magical training, Cynwise provides protection for the villagers from the seabound raiders, able to call upon the elements and harness deeper energies.  Still, these powers have made her frightening among her own people, who both respect and fear her.  Not quite an outsider, but not accepted either, Cynwise spends most of her days tending to her books and studies.
CYNWISE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cynwise murmurs, "A poor omen, this cold wind. Do you feel it? Bitter as dragon's breath..."
KEW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A grizzled old adventurer, Kew's glory days are years behind him.  A tall, well-built man with snow-white hair, Kew wears an ornate dagger at his waist as the only indication of his life that was.
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kew says, "I've heard of a evil in the old dungeons, but my adventuring days are done. Take my supplies to help you on your way."

EXILE_DESCRIPTION_SID=The exile
EXILE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The exile looks at you sadly.  "I am an exile, the last of my kin.  This is my home til the salt eats my bones."
EXILE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient man, dressed in little more than rags, the exile is hobbled and bent.  Cast away to the edge of the world, he lives his life far from the forces that sent him here.  His only colour comes from his deep green eyes, and a number of gold rings that adorn his right hand.
FARMER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=farmer
FARMER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a farmer
FARMER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A vital part of any settlement, the farmer provides food from the earth to feed his people.  Knowledgable about agriculture, herbalism, and other matters, the farmer provides vital sustenance when stocks of meat and fish wane.
FARMER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The farmer says, "A good crop, last year.  And we owe it to one man - the ploughman."
HRIMGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar stands tall and proud, chief of the Isenlings, entrusted with the protection and prosperity of his people.  He wears a wolfskin about his shoulders, and underneath, a vest of chain mail; his face is a mass of lines and creases, betraying his deep age.  Hrimgar looks to be a man in his twilight, hopeful to guide his people through just a few more winters.
HRIMGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of the Isenlings, Hrimgar is a tall, regal man.  Just a shade under forty, his hair and beard have begun to grey; but despite this, he still looks strong and powerful, and is said to still lead the charge of his people into battle.
HRIMGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hrimgar says, "You are welcome in our lands, traveller."
GARROS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ugly, scarred man, Garros is missing an eye, an ear, and several teeth.  The remnants of a ratty cape hang from his shoulders, closed by a cheap wooden clasp, and his boots look ill-fitting.  But at his waist you can see a large, stone hammer, its curved head filthy and caked with blood.
GARROS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Garros cackles, "How appropriate that you shall perish here!  Your life shall a-mound to nothing!"
HOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hound
HOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hound
HOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large dog descended at some point from wolves, the hound is easily trained by men for guarding, work, or even just companionship.  Hounds are smaller than their wolven brethren, and less muscular, but they can still be ferocious when provoked.
HOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hound growls.
WHITE_WOLF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a white wolf
WHITE_WOLF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=The white wolf is a larger cousin of the common wolf.  Typically found in colder climates, its silvery-white fur provides natural camouflage in the snow-covered arctic tundras and boreal forests.  Despite the size of the species, the white wolf possesses a high-pitched howl, closer in timbre to a coyote's.  They typically feed on mammals such as deer, foxes, and rabbits, but in times of hunger, they have been known to attack camps and settlements.
WHITE_WOLF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The white wolf growls.
CYCLOPS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=cyclops
CYCLOPS_DESCRIPTION_SID=a cyclops
CYCLOPS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient race of giants, the cyclopes tower over the tallest giants and ogres.  The cyclops is distinguished by a single eye in the middle of its forehead.  Typically at least sixty feet tall, they dress in patchwork skins sewn from elephant and rhino hides.  They are quick to anger.  Cyclopes carry clubs fashioned from the trunks of huge trees, the ends studded with spikes of mammoth tusks.  They live deep in the highest mountain ranges, gathering in small clans to build stone dwellings and live their lives far from the rest of the world.
CYCLOPS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The cyclops thunders, "I shall destroy you!"
CHIMERA_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=chimera
CHIMERA_DESCRIPTION_SID=a chimera
CHIMERA_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chimeras are the monstrous fusion of a goat's body, a lion's head, and a serpent tail.  Agents of pure chaos and destruction, they breathe fire, attacking anything in their way.  While they were originally thought to be the recent creation of the Sceadugenga, a number of bronze statues from long-lost civilizations have been unearthed, suggesting these creatures terrorized the civilized world as far back as recorded time.
CHIMERA_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The chimera hisses, bleats, and roars.
WYRM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=wyrm
WYRM_DESCRIPTION_SID=a wyrm
WYRM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Though the modern "worm" derives from the ancient "wyrm", it does its ancestor no justice.  Wyrms are massive, fire-breathing serpents that live deep beneath the earth: in caverns, mines, and any other passage large enough to house their massive forms.  They have a deep love of gold.  Greedy and hungry, they lie coiled on their great hoards, aware of each coin, each goblet and gem.  Their anger is immense, and when they roar, the very earth trembles.
WYRM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The wyrm opens its great jaws to the sky, and breathes a terrible flame high into the air.
THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thief
THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thief
THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Disliked everywhere and trusted nowhere, the thief lives outside of society, taking what he can, and by force if necessary.  Many work alone, but in the larger central cities, they have been known to form guilds, forging a common bond and language.  They are despised by those who do honest work, who see them as uncouth at best, and murderous at worst.  This is not entirely incorrect.
THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thief scowls, "I'll spill your guts, then take the coins from your eyes!"
APPRENTICE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apprentice
APPRENTICE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apprentice
APPRENTICE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Apprentices study the arcane arts under practicing wizards.  As with acolytes and their holy path, apprentices leave their homes at a young age to work under established wizards, where they learn to read Old Runic, prepare herbs and distillations, and acquiring other prerequisites to the magical arts.  Their days are spent in service, assisting their master, while their nights are spent reading ancient texts, mastering the language and linguistics of the old magics.  After a number of years, once their study is deemed satisfactory, they receive their wizard's staff.  Each will say, though, that the staff is truly only the beginning of their study.
APPRENTICE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apprentice murmurs, "All men pass to dust, but what we study in life defines us."
GRAVEROBBER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=As the thief is to the honest occupations, so is the graverobber to thieves.  Possessing none of the respect for the dead (and many of their possessions), the graverobber makes his wealth off the death of others, disinterring the dead for their weapons, ivory, and gold.
GRAVEROBBER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The graverobber laughs, "You know what I love best about my job? The dead can't protest!"
BLACKGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackguard
BLACKGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackguard
BLACKGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Blackguards are known by many other names: mercenary, sellsword, brigand, outlaw.  Usually possessing only a simple sword and the clothes on their back, they rely on their wits and skill in combat to make a living, fighting in armies in other peoples' wars, or simply waylaying strangers on back roads.
BLACKGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A blackguard spits, "You worthless cur! I'll cut you down where you stand!"
OGRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre
OGRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre
OGRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogres are huge and thickly-built, with the strength of many men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures’ fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.  Ogres make up for this with a tremendous strength and fortitude.  They are often seen wearing scraps of armour plundered from their kills, and often carry some sort of clubs, some even wielding the trunks of small trees.
OGRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre snarls, "I'll grind your bones to make my bread!"
OGRE_SAVAGE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre savage
OGRE_SAVAGE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Evil and cruel, even for ogres, ogre savages wear their fallen foes.  They wear necklaces made from their victims' skulls.  The skins are tanned and made into clothing, and their clubs are spiked with bones.  Ogre savages tend to wear little armour, preferring to fortify themselves with strange potions brewed by their shamans.
OGRE_SAVAGE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre savage roars, "I'll add your skull to my necklace!"
URGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Armoured in scraps of plate, carrying a huge, spiked club, Urgrim is an imposing presence.  His eyes burn beneath the visor of a plundered helm, beady and small, full of hate.  Leader of his band, he arrived at his authority through ruthlessness, slaughtering the previous chief in full view of his tribe and daring any to try the same with him.
URGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Urgrim spits, "I'll hang your flayed skin on the walls of my camp!"

ISEN_DUN_CHRONICLE_TEXT_SID=540 In this year Wulf Hrimling sailed to this island of fifty miles long and twelve miles across.  And he found a point with tombs already dug and a silver tree above, and he built a keep atop the tombs, and called it Wintersea. %p 541 In this year Wulf founded a village on the hill, called Isen Dun. %p 562 Here came sea-raiders, men of steel and fire.  Aelwin destroyed their ships as they approached the village, and they were repelled to the shore and destroyed. %p 583 Sailors from the north visited, wood elves of Yew, who said they hail north-north-west, on an island of forests and caves.  A feast was had with much elf wine. %p 584 Great Wulf Hrimcyning died asleep, and he was buried beneath Wintersea. %p 588 For two years there was no rain.  We dug a well and fished the sea but many died. %p 607 Here a priest came and brought the word of Celeste to Isen Dun.  For three years we laboured to build a small church in Her name. %p 616 With calm winds, we had many visitors this year.  One told of a village of gnomes called Gnordvar, far to the north.  We are told it is up against a mountainside and the gnomes are friendly. %p 622 The steel men returned.  They came from the north but found only cliffs.  We rained fire arrows and pitch and the steel men fled. %p 623 A mercenary named Cinas has taught us to make catapults.  We have made four, should the raiders return. %p 644 In this year the sea was teeming with fish.  We have salted away many for the winter. %p 657 Here we met dwarves, stout explorers who sailed their ships here, at the edge of the world.  We gave them fresh water and salt fish, and they gifted us a pot still for whisky.  They told us their home was far, far north west. %p 668 Mountain elves visited, strong-elves from the west.  They told us the dwarves had spoken of us.  These men did not talk much but were not unkind. %p 674 In this year an emissary of the High Church was sent.  Aethelwulf Isenking received him, and the emissary was pleased with the village, for we are all of us devoted to Celeste, glory to her name.  He stayed for two winters and helped us build a rectory.  We sent a boy with him to be trained as a priest. %p 678 Cadbert returned from the high church and here he lived for sixty years. %p 692 A great plague came on the air.  Many of us fell sick of the mouth-bleeding.  Garamund, a learned man, brought great magic to ward off the sickness. %p 740 After many years of peace, raiders came on a great storm.  I have heard there were dragons overhead lighting the way.  Ten longships came, teeming with goblins.  They had with them ogres and many beasts.  We laid traps and magics leading inland, and every man had a bow and sixty arrows.  Still, half the village was burnt, and only the church was saved by Celeste's grace.  We fought them to the death and we lost many men, many good men.  But we destroyed the monsters, and captured their longships. %p 747 Sailors from the west have said that the goblins and ogres came from the far side of the world. %p 749 One of the goblin-ships we captured sunk in a storm.  We salvaged as much wood as we could and made things for the church: pews, a small dais, a new altar. %p 780 There was bitter fighting this year between Aeschere and Osmund.  Aeschere and his kin left this island, taking their ships north-west. %p 785 We have heard that Aeschere's men made home on a small island they call Aeschburh. %p 798 Eighteen winters after Aeschere left, that island has sent two ships to trade with us.  We have traded skins and ore for spice wine and silver.  Our silver-smith Wilfrid has been given a measure of the silver and tasked with making mead-cups, cloak-clasps, and ornaments. %p 804 A ship of wood-elves has come to trade and told us that the last fae have been found.  Their land lies as far north as we are south. %p 808 The goblins have sacked Aeschburh, and put every man to the sword.  Their fortress lies empty now, though some have said at night there are lights that dance in the dark. %p 825 In this year, a young man has come to lead our sermons and prayers.  His name is Oswyn, a good man of the south.  Also Hrimgar has been made chief.  He is son of Hrimhere, son of Eadbert, himself son of Aethelric, one of Aethelwulf's kin. %p 851 Rumblings from the north-west: something has stirred, something long quiet.
