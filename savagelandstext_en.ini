SKELETON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Skeletons are the bones of the dead infused with unholy magics to give them form once more.  The bones are weakly separated by magic.

SKELETAL_WARRIOR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The skeletal warrior's jaws clatter loudly.

Shades roughly resemble the person they once were, but with formless features.  Their eyes are a milky white, their skin soft and black, with a velvet-like texture.

SKELETAL_DRAGON_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=To create a skeleton requires effort and concentration, for the will of the creature must be battled and overcome when unlife fills the body.  Because of this, few sorcerors attempt to reanimate the bones of a dragon.  Those that try usually end up crushed immediately by the dragon's tail, or impaled on the razor-teeth of its maw.  It is said that the great spellbinders of a previous age kept skeletal dragons as a sign of their personal power, the names of these wizards found carved on runic tablets deep in caves: Pelle, Falamar, and Wealhwin.

GNOME_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnome
GNOME_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnome
GNOME_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Gnomes are tiny creatures that live in caverns and caves, and have since recorded time.  They stand even shorter than dwarves, and are much less strong.  They are intelligent and quick; gnomes love riddles and puzzles, and have a deep affinity for magic.  In combat, they show skill with knives and other short blades.
GNOME_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnome says, "The underground's getting rather dangerous lately.  Wonder what it is?"
GNOMISH_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish child
GNOMISH_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Barely a foot and a half high, the gnomish child's clothes are torn and stained, its hair a mess of leaves and dirt.  The child has either lost or abandoned its shoes, and its feet are tanned the same deep brown as the rest of it.  Its pockets look to be teeming: with bugs and worms, shiny stones, and anything else that has captured its attention, however briefly.
GNOMISH_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish child stares at you with huge eyes. "Can I have some candy?"
GNOMISH_MINER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a gnomish miner
GNOMISH_MINER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Delving deep beneath the earth, hauling ore and gems to the surface, the gnomish miner lives a life in near darkness.  Caked with coal-dust, sweat, and grime, his skin has taken on a greyish hue.  His eyes narrow, squinting, his vision decimated by a life spent underground.  But despite these maladies, with thick, heavy arms, and a broad chest, the gnome looks more like a dwarf, stocky and powerful.
GNOMISH_MINER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The gnomish miner says, "My father was a peat-cutter, and I have no spade to follow him.  But I've got my pick; I'll dig with that."
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Theodoric, priest of Vedere
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A tall man, towering over the gnomes he serves, Theodoric built and maintains the small stone temple in Gnordvar.  After studying as an acolyte in the inner isles, Theodoric was granted a boat and told to make harbour wherever he was needed.  He sailed east, and arrived in Gnordvar a dozen years ago.  With the blessing of its people, he built a temple for the village, and now leads a simple life of prayer and healing among the smallest people of the world.
GNORDVAR_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Theodoric smiles. "All of Vedere's creatures are welcome here, in our humble temple."
LIGHTNING_BUG_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_DESCRIPTION_SID=a lightning bug
LIGHTNING_BUG_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Large, flying insects that glow brightly, lightning bugs store charges of electricity.  They are typically harmless, but will fight back when provoked, and the strength of their electrical charge is so great that it has been known to cause temporary paralysis.
LIGHTNING_BUG_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The lightning bug buzzes and flickers.
FROST_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a frost devil
FROST_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Small creatures of cold and ice, frost devils travel on freezing winds, culling the sick and infirm, the very young, the dying.  Barely a foot high, they resemble tiny children.  Their skin has a white-grey hue, and their eyes are a bright, startling blue.  They are ferocious.  Knowing no fear, they attack creatures many times their size, slowing them with a bite of terrible, numbing cold.
FROST_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The frost devil screams, and a cold wind surrounds you.
FIRE_DEVIL_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fire devil
FIRE_DEVIL_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Remnants of an older time, fire devils live deep within the earth, far past the homes dug by the dwarves and gnomes, with whom they war constantly.  Beings of intense mischief, fire devils arise from cracks and canyons to wreak havoc on living things, igniting with their touch and leaving little but cinders and char, their high-pitched laughs echoing behind.
FIRE_DEVIL_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fire devil cackles, and its flames flicker and dance.
AMAUROSIS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ancient wyrm, Amaurosis
AMAUROSIS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient wyrm, the last of his kind, Amaurosis lives deep within the caverns of the barren northwest isle.  His body is impossibly long; his mind is even more cunning.  Born of chaotic magics as the world just began, he ravaged the peoples of the world twice in recorded history, finally sealed back by the great warlocks of old.  But as their numbers dwindled, so too did his seal, and it is said that thunder and smoke fill the air once more.
AMAUROSIS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ancient wyrm emits a piercing shriek, causing the caverns to rumble.
FISHERMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=fisherman
FISHERMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=a fisherman
FISHERMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Where there are lakes, rivers, and oceans, there are fisherman: simple, honest folk who feed their families and peoples through the bounty of the waters.  They travel in coracles and skiffs, dromonds and longboats, alone or in teams, fishing with line, nets, and spears.  Salt fish is a common winter staple among many people, who rely on stores of it to see them through to spring.
FISHERMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The fisherman says, "Good fishing, today."
SEAWIFE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=seawife
SEAWIFE_DESCRIPTION_SID=a seawife
SEAWIFE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Fishermen are married to the open water, but those that take wives must leave them regularly in search of their catch. The seawives tend to the home in the absence of their husbands; they mend clothes and nets, raise the children, and salt the last trip's fish.
SEAWIFE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The seawife says, "Each time my husband goes to sea, he leaves me stranded in the shoals."
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_DESCRIPTION_SID=the ploughman
THE_PLOUGHMAN_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A smug, simpering creature, the ploughman brags and boasts of his importance within society.  Immortalized by the colloquy of a certain monk, he is less appreciated by his fellow villagers, who see the man as useful, but still an insufferable git.
THE_PLOUGHMAN_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ploughman gloats, "Whose grain makes the loaf? Whose turnips make the mash? The ploughman's!"
THE_BLACKSMITH_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_DESCRIPTION_SID=the blacksmith
THE_BLACKSMITH_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Due to the recent publication of a colloquy on the occupations, the blacksmith's prominent place in society is suddenly under attack.  Formerly lionized for his skills, for crafting weapons of war and implements of peace alike, for smithing spears and shoeing horses, the blacksmith now must fight for respect after a particular monk declared that "the ploughman feeds us all."
THE_BLACKSMITH_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The blacksmith scoffs, "That miserable, braggart ploughman!  Who hews his hoe?  Who smelts his steel?"
SMALL_CHILD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=small child
SMALL_CHILD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a small child
SMALL_CHILD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Covered in dirt and filthy rags, the child runs about screaming, ever underfoot.
SMALL_CHILD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The small child says, "One, two, slime on my shoe.  Three, four, a wyrm's mighty roar!"
VILLAGE_PRIEST_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_DESCRIPTION_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste
VILLAGE_PRIEST_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Oswyn, priest of Celeste, maintains a small church within the village of Isen Dun, leading nightly prayers and tending to the sick and wounded.

VILLAGE_PRIEST_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Oswyn intones, "Hail Celeste, empress of heaven, by whose will all things are made."
CYNWISE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_DESCRIPTION_SID=Cynwise
CYNWISE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An older, childless woman, Cynwise lives at the fringes of Isen Dun.  One of the few villagers with any magical training, Cynwise provides protection for the villagers from the seabound raiders, able to call upon the elements and harness deeper energies.  Still, these powers have made her frightening among her own people, who both respect and fear her.  Not quite an outsider, but not accepted either, Cynwise spends most of her days tending to her books and studies.
CYNWISE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Cynwise murmurs, "A poor omen, this cold wind. Do you feel it? Bitter as dragon's breath..."
KEW_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_DESCRIPTION_SID=Kew
KEW_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A grizzled old adventurer, Kew's glory days are years behind him.  A tall, well-built man with snow-white hair, Kew wears an ornate dagger at his waist as the only indication of his life that was.
KEW_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Kew says, "I've heard of a evil in the old dungeons, but my adventuring days are done. Take my supplies to help you on your way."
KEW_SUPPLIES_SPEECH_SID=Kew laughs, "Traveller, you will need more than that to stay alive! Take this key, and help yourself to my old equipment."
EXILE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=exile
EXILE_DESCRIPTION_SID=The exile
EXILE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The exile looks at you sadly.  "I am an exile, the last of my kin.  This is my home til the salt eats my bones."
EXILE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ancient man, dressed in little more than rags, the exile is hobbled and bent.  Cast away to the edge of the world, he lives his life far from the forces that sent him here.  His only colour comes from his deep green eyes, and a number of gold rings that adorn his right hand.
FARMER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=farmer
FARMER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a farmer
FARMER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A vital part of any settlement, the farmer provides food from the earth to feed his people.  Knowledgable about agriculture, herbalism, and other matters, the farmer provides vital sustenance when stocks of meat and fish wane.
FARMER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The farmer says, "A good crop, last year.  And we owe it to one man - the ploughman."
HRIMGAR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar
HRIMGAR_DESCRIPTION_SID=Hrimgar stands tall and proud, chief of the Isenlings, entrusted with the protection and prosperity of his people.  He wears a wolfskin about his shoulders, and underneath, a vest of chain mail; his face is a mass of lines and creases, betraying his deep age.  Hrimgar looks to be a man in his twilight, hopeful to guide his people through just a few more winters.
HRIMGAR_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Chief of the Isenlings, Hrimgar is a tall, regal man.  Just a shade under forty, his hair and beard have begun to grey; but despite this, he still looks strong and powerful, and is said to still lead the charge of his people into battle.
HRIMGAR_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Hrimgar says, "You are welcome in our lands, traveller."
GARROS_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_DESCRIPTION_SID=Garros Barrows-Thief
GARROS_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=An ugly, scarred man, Garros is missing an eye, an ear, and several teeth.  The remnants of a ratty cape hang from his shoulders, closed by a cheap wooden clasp, and his boots look ill-fitting.  But at his waist you can see a large, stone hammer, its curved head filthy and caked with blood.
GARROS_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Garros cackles, "How appropriate that you shall perish here!  Your life shall a-mound to nothing!"
HOUND_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=hound
HOUND_DESCRIPTION_SID=a hound
HOUND_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=A large dog descended at some point from wolves, the hound is easily trained by men for guarding, work, or even just companionship.  Hounds are smaller than their wolven brethren, and less muscular, but they can still be ferocious when provoked.
HOUND_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The hound growls.
THIEF_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=thief
THIEF_DESCRIPTION_SID=a thief
THIEF_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Disliked everywhere and trusted nowhere, the thief lives outside of society, taking what he can, and by force if necessary.  Many work alone, but in the larger central cities, they have been known to form guilds, forging a common bond and language.  They are despised by those who do honest work, who see them as uncouth at best, and murderous at worst.  This is not entirely incorrect.
THIEF_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The thief scowls, "I'll spill your guts, then take the coins from your eyes!"
APPRENTICE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=apprentice
APPRENTICE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an apprentice
APPRENTICE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Apprentices study the arcane arts under practicing wizards.  As with acolytes and their holy path, apprentices leave their homes at a young age to work under established wizards, where they learn to read Old Runic, prepare herbs and distillations, and acquiring other prerequisites to the magical arts.  Their days are spent in service, assisting their master, while their nights are spent reading ancient texts, mastering the language and linguistics of the old magics.  After a number of years, once their study is deemed satisfactory, they receive their wizard's staff.  Each will say, though, that the staff is truly only the beginning of their study.
APPRENTICE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The apprentice murmurs, "All men pass to dust, but what we study in life defines us."
GRAVEROBBER_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_DESCRIPTION_SID=a graverobber
GRAVEROBBER_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=As the thief is to the honest occupations, so is the graverobber to thieves.  Possessing none of the respect for the dead (and many of their possessions), the graverobber makes his wealth off the death of others, disinterring the dead for their weapons, ivory, and gold.
GRAVEROBBER_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The graverobber laughs, "You know what I love best about my job? The dead can't protest!"
BLACKGUARD_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=blackguard
BLACKGUARD_DESCRIPTION_SID=a blackguard
BLACKGUARD_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Blackguards are known by many other names: mercenary, sellsword, brigand, outlaw.  Usually possessing only a simple sword and the clothes on their back, they rely on their wits and skill in combat to make a living, fighting in armies in other peoples' wars, or simply waylaying strangers on back roads.
BLACKGUARD_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=A blackguard spits, "You worthless cur! I'll cut you down where you stand!"
OGRE_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=ogre
OGRE_DESCRIPTION_SID=an ogre
OGRE_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Ogres are huge and thickly-built, with the strength of many men.  Though they are often seen with goblins, and share those creatures’ fierce nature, they are not nearly as intelligent.  Ogres make up for this with a tremendous strength and fortitude.  They are often seen wearing scraps of armour plundered from their kills, and often carry some sort of clubs, some even wielding the trunks of small trees.
OGRE_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=The ogre snarls, "I'll grind your bones to make my bread!"
URGRIM_SHORT_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_DESCRIPTION_SID=Urgrim
URGRIM_TEXT_DETAILS_SID=Armoured in scraps of plate, carrying a huge, spiked club, Urgrim is an imposing presence.  His eyes burn beneath the visor of a plundered helm, beady and small, full of hate.  Leader of his band, he arrived at his authority through ruthlessness, slaughtering the previous chief in full view of his tribe and daring any to try the same with him.
URGRIM_SPEECH_TEXT_SID=Urgrim spits, "I'll hang your flayed skin on the walls of my camp!"
